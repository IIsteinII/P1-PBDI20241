1;"South Africa,14,3920,""Toast and fresh hay aromas immediately waft from the glass, with supporting notes of red apple and spiced orange peel. Round and full in the mouth, it has good mousse and a soft honeyed accent that carries through onto the finish.""";
2;"Austria,38,19000,""You can feel the richness of this wine as it rolls opulently around the mouth. The Grüner spice character is dominant, giving intense concentration to go with the yellow fruits. Acidity is a balanced addition to the mix on this impressive wine.""";
3;"Italy,4,18400,""This wine shows growing intensity the longer it stays in the glass and a very silky, polished feel in the mouth. Aromas include red fruit, spice and rosemary: this is a beautiful, balanced wine that will have a long life in your cellar.""";
4;"US,1003,421260,""Zin hardly gets riper or fruitier than this. Blended with a little Petite Sirah, which accounts for the tannins and depth, it's jam-packed with wild berries, currants, licorice, cocoa, black pepper and sandalwood, while high alcohol gives it a rich, glycerine mouthfeel.""";
5;"Spain,2,1120,""Smooth and lightly roasted on the bouquet, this has tobacco, cola, fine oak and earthy berry aromas. It feels generous but a little soft and syrupy, with raisin, licorice and savory baked-fruit flavors. The finish is long and continues to be savory tasting. Drink now–2014.""";
6;"Romania,1,300,""There's a striking minerality that adds depth to varietally characteristic scents of ripe cassis, violets and cedar. Full bodied and densely concentrated, with sweet, black-fruit flavor, it's balanced by brisk acidity and fresh herb flavors that linger on the finish.""";
7;"Italy,503,95570,""Yellow flower, ripe orchard fruit and aromatic herb aromas take center stage while the ripe, round palate offers mature yellow apple and candied lemon notes. A hint of bitter almond finish marks the close.""";
8;"Spain,230,39100,""You wouldn't call this wine “clean and polished.” It has some old country brett along with fig, earth, mushroom and liqueur on the nose. That said, it's dishing up heavy servings of chocolate and baked berry pie flavors. A big, bulky wine that's already losing clarity. This won't be for everyone.""";
9;"Slovenia,3,690,""This orange-style wine is dark straw in color and has jasmine and vanilla tones on the nose, while flavors of canned apricots and fresh peaches drive the palate. There's a soft and sensuous finish, due to the 18 month barrels aging.""";
10;"Spain,1,1420,""There's no denying the wine's power and intensity. It's concentrated like a cement block, with richness, plummy aromas, sweetness and char. But it's also candied and ultrarich in the mouth, with syrupy flavors of berry extract, cola and chocolate. A heavy wine that shows every ounce of its 15.5% alcohol. Ultimately it's more sweet and powerful than it is precise. Drink now through 2013.""";
11;"Spain,1,1880,""Valbuena is Vega Sicilia's so-called second wine, and this vintage is elegant and lithe. To equate it to Burgundian Pinot Noir is not a stretch, seeing that the nose is earthy and dry, with fresh flowers, leather and tobacco aromas. The palate is light and full of finesse, with airy cranberry, earth and cherry flavors. From a poor vintage, this is more than admirable. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.""";
12;"France,7,6160,""With seven years on lees before disgorgement, this wine already shows some maturity. It is rich while also having the intense acidity of the vintage. Turning to gold in color, it is balanced and dry as with all the Paillard wines, although with age that character becomes less obvious. Drink now for the fruit or until 2024.""";
13;"Argentina,1,40,""Crimson in color but also translucent, with a candied, slightly green nose. Overall this is a simple quaffer with no excess weight and reasonably good flavors of berry and plum. Bland on the finish, but for $4 who's caring about finish?""";
14;"Spain,1,2470,""Aurus defines awesome modern Rioja. The nose is floral and decked out with wild berry aromas, marzipan, vanilla and hard spices. The palate is powerful and tannic, with bold cassis, raspberry, cherry, coffee and chocolate flavors. Beautifully crafted and with a nice red fruit element courtesy of 15% Graciano to go with old vines Tempranillo. Drink from 2012–2021.""";
15;"Australia,1,620,""This is a herbaceous expression of Shiraz from the under appreciated Heathcote region of Victoria, and made by Emily Laughton, daughter of the well-regarded Jasper Hill family. Mint and green herbs mingle with potpourri, juicy fruit, and charred oak characters. Tannins are tightly wound at the moment, but the wine is well balanced and here for the long haul. Drink 2020–2032.""";
16;"Moldova,1,230,""This golden colored ice wine is made from Riesling and has aromas of honeydew melon, apple, peach and honeysuckle blossoms. In the mouth, there are flavors of apricot, cantaloupe and white peach with a nice level of acidity to balance the sweet finish.""";
17;"Spain,1,1030,""This 10-year-old wine from a hot vintage is soft and plump but has gaps in its fiber. The mouth is tannic around the edges but lacks stuffing, while flavors of plum and berry run jammy and heavy. A hollow finish with prune flavors and dry tannins is the final act.""";
18;"France,1,5950,""A beautifully balanced wine that exudes elegance as well as richness. It is drier than previous vintages of Cristal Rosé, yielding a bright, crisp and layered wine. Red fruits are married with orange zest and tight acidity. It can be drunk now, but it is a young wine and will certainly age well through 2022.""";
19;"New Zealand,2,760,""Winemaker Matt Dicey has teased out Pinot Noir's silky texture and ample complexity in this wine, one of his finest to date. Cherry fruit hints at rose petals and picks up subtle earth and spice shadings on the palate, finishing with elegance and class. Drink now–2012, although its balance may permit it to hold for several more years after that.""";
20;"Italy,7,7840,""Vigna Cerretta shapes a smoky wine with notes of black fruit, road tar, licorice and spice. The wine presents an upfront layer of aromas but doesn't offer as much depth after that. Give it time to find harmony and loosen its tight tannins. Drink after 2015.""";
21;"Chile,7,8750,""This ripe, dark Maipo Syrah opens with slightly generic aromas of blackberry and black cherry. Rich, resiny and creamy on the palate, this tastes oaky at first";
22;"Italy,2,7500,""You can smell those distinctive notes from the muffa nobile, or botrytis, that has shaped a deep and layered wine with notes of peach fuzz, candied fruit, apricot and white almond. The wine is sweet, but not exaggeratedly so, and has a bright, elegant mouthfeel.""";
23;"France,3,4980,""Very terroir-driven from chalk soil in this great vineyard, this firmly structured wine is powerful and solid. There is a mineral character at this stage of the wine's development, with 60% new wood giving a lightly smoky feel. Drink from 2017.""";
24;"Germany,3,2970,""Billowing with scents of marmalade, wildflower honey and raspberry preserves, this is an intoxicatingly perfumed TBA, but the palate doesn't disappoint either. Rich and creamy with undulating streaks of peach preserve and tangerine, it lingers on and on, with its tea and honey-kissed finish.""";
25;"Portugal,1,4990,""Harvested the year a princess became Queen Elizabeth II, this wine aged in oak until now. Bottled in 2016, this is a deep old-gold colored wine. On the palate, it is rich and sweet, with flavors of wood contrasting with the beautiful raisin and prune flavors. It is still impressively fresh and vibrant. It is, of course, ready to drink now.""";
26;"England,1,950,""Oatmeal, chalk and bread crust form the first impression. On the palate they play upon a tart and lively freshness and round out crisp, green apple fruit. Together they fill the palate while gentle fizz illuminates more of the bready, stony flavors. Restraint is the central theme here.""";
27;"Australia,3,4350,""One of Australia's most expensive and sought-after Cabernet blends, Mount Mary's Quintet has failed to impress more than one American critic. It's an appealing, well-crafted wine that combines leather, cherry and dried herbs in a somewhat lean, crisp style that delivers a long, mineral-and-cedar finish.""";
28;"US,1,4000,""This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon was aged for 26 months in 50% new French oak. The mouthfeel is soft and luxurious. This wine was bottled only in magnums, and it's gorgeous and delicious, with classic blackberry, cherry, currant and dark chocolate flavors. Despite its full body, the wine has an elegant silkiness that's light and feathery. This is clearly the greatest Cabernet Clos du Val has ever produced. Drink now–2026.""";
29;"Austria,1,860,""Kracher TBA wines are numbered in ascending order of intensity. Even at this medium level of intensity, this is an impressive wine. It has that fine balance, pushing its rich marmalade and dried apricot flavors right up to intense acidity. The wine is certainly full, but keeps a delicacy and great lightness of touch.""";
30;"Canada,12,2160,""With its intense scents and flavors of orange candy, Muscat is often made in a sweet style, but here it shows its dry side, and to good effect. Bright and penetrating scents and flavors hit on the entire spectrum of oranges, with excellent weight, precision and concentration. A touch of candied ginger adds further interest.""";
31;"Argentina,4,2720,""This single-vineyard Malbec blend from vineyards that sit at 6,500 feet smells dark, grilled and rubbery, but also meaty and full of fruit. A full, lush palate avoids fierceness and lays on the richness. Toasty, lightly herbal berry and plum flavors are highly appealing. The wine tastes of herbs, salted meat and spices on a complex finish. Drink through 2024.""";
32;"France,1,19000,""A massive wine for Margaux, packed with tannins and ripe fruit. It has more Cabernet Sauvignon than usual, giving intense black currant flavors with enticing acidity balanced by the sweetness of the fruit. Ripe swathes of this opulent fruit are also elegant and structured.""";
33;"Canada,4,1360,""This pure varietal bottling spent 18 months in oak, emerging perfectly proportioned with deftly integrated flavors of berry and herb, and a touch of fresh snap peas. The tannins carry the characteristic green olive notes, and the finish offers the scent and flavor of ground coffee as well. Overall a very fine effort.""";
34;"Italy,27,18090,""Truffle, chopped mint, woodland berry and eucalyptus aromas unfold in the glass. Bright and juicy, the palate evokes succulent red berries, star anise, clove and tobacco, set against a backdrop of firm, polished tannins. Fresh acidity lends balance. Drink 2019–2027.""";
35;"US,1,1680,""This wine backs up the price tag with a fruit-forward nose showing blackberry, black cherry, dried mint and tarragon. The palate is more tart, with dried sour cherries, espresso-bean bitterness, lava rocks and graphite. It's surprisingly both dark and lean, offering solid complexity.""";
36;"France,596,95360,""Yes, this wine comes from a village of Chardonnay in the Mâcon region of Burgundy. It's a typical, crisp, freshly green Chardonnay that zings on to the palate. No wood here, just light grapefruit and citrus flavors, rounded with a touch of apple. Screwcap.""";
37;"Austria,46,9660,""Wonderfully zesty notes of lime peel are joined by savory hints of fern and riper notes of juicy, yellow pear. The palate is slender but expressive and adds more green pear notes alongside a lemony, easy freshness. This is concentrated and convincing.""";
38;"Italy,4,9000,""Roberto Conterno didn't make his flagship Monfortino in this vintage so he blended the juice destined for this iconic wine into Francia. It opens with enticing aromas of dark berry, underbrush, baking spice, mineral and a balsamic note that carry over to the powerful palate, along with juicy raspberry, licorice and tobacco. It's big and structured but also shows balance and complexity. Drink 2019–2029.""";
39;"US,1,1380,""Jammy, rich and leathery, this full-bodied, robust wine has a touch of smoke lingering in the back, beneath soft, well-integrated oak. Juicy, it's enjoyable now, while being structured enough to go another decade or so. Cellar through 2021.""";
40;"Argentina,9,9900,""This is top-notch Argentine Cabernet Franc. Savory, exotic, oaky blueberry and blackberry aromas set up a bold palate with ample acidity and modest tannins. Berry flavors and oak spice are the key flavors, while a buttery oak note and a pinch of salt rise up on the finish. Drink now through 2018.""";
41;"Bulgaria,18,2520,""This wine has aromas of cherry cola and freshly picked cherries. In the mouth there are flavors of tart cherry and black raspberry, with balanced tannins and a long finish.""";
42;"Italy,59,31860,""You'll find wild red berry, coconut, leather, dark spice and balsamic notes on the nose of this wine. They infuse the palate, accenting its espresso-like flavor. It's full-bodied, with a backbone of close-grained tannins that give the finish grip. Drink 2019–2027.""";
43;"US,2086,375480,""Zucca has made a fragrant and floral Sangiovese Rosato here, dry like cherry jam on toast and a nutty finish. Pair it with tropically seasoned seafood.""";
44;"New Zealand,13,4290,""This wine is initially marked by scents of charred oak and espresso beans. With aeration, the cherry fruit become more apparent. It's medium to full in body, with silky yet firm tannins that reflect the vineyard's clay soils.""";
45;"Italy,11,8030,""Very supple on the palate, this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend has dense black cherry aromas and flavors framed by dill oak.  Earth notes add a touch of complexity and the finish is full, with tobacco-earth accents.  Attractive and easy-to-like as it is, but the wine seems to have the potential for more nuance and dimension than it presently shows.""";
46;"Argentina,1,760,""Chunky black-fruit aromas are ripe but familiar, meaning the nose is pumped full of richness and oak. Racy acidity on the palate gives this modern Cab spine, while in the mouthfeel stays on the fast track due to zesty acidity. Flavors of cassis and blackberry register as fresh and ripe, and the finish is crisp and not the least bit flabby. Drink through 2016.""";
47;"Turkey,1,350,""Inky violet red to the eye, this wine made of native Turkish variety Öküzgözü offers a beautiful combination of fruit and spice flavors that are only hinted at by aromas of black cherry, talc and violet. Harmonious flavors of cassis, blackberry jam, anisette, vanilla bean and coffee roll on the tongue among silky tannins through a finish that features a lasting sense of black cherry and anise.""";
48;"Chile,6,2220,""Woodsy earthy berry aromas share the nose with fresh-cut oak scents. This Carmenère-Syrah blend feels lively and juicy, not heavy or flat. Dark spicy berry and plum flavors include notes of olive and oak, while the finish is spicy and tastes of olive and tobacco.""";
49;"Portugal,24,5040,""With aromas of wood aging, this is a tropical fruit and spice flavored wine. It displays a strong sense of texture and freshness. It is already showing richness as well as a good sense of style. Drink from 2015.""";
50;"England,2,1040,""Lively, crisp apple notes on the nose immediately signal freshness. The palate follows with equally brisk green apple and citrus notes, mellowed fittingly with a very fine, soft and creamy mousse. This is lithe, dew-fresh and of great purity. It conjures up visions of clear brooks, green meadows and budding elderflower. The crisp green-apple notes echo long and make for a totally refreshing, brisk finish.""";
51;"Spain,1,2580,""This gorgeous dessert wine shows a coffee-colored tint that's backed by lush, deep aromas of fig, caramel, toffee and prune. The palate shows weight but a refined mouthfeel that's not sticky or heavy. Flavors of coffee, mocha, chocolate, caramel, peanut brittle and prune finish warm and long. Only 43 cases made.""";
52;"Portugal,1,1080,""Offley, established in 1737, is a famous old Port house. This 30-year-old tawny, aged in the cellars at Vila Nova de Gaia at the mouth of the Douro river, has a strong sense of wood aging that gives acidity and a golden glow to the palate. Like any aged tawny, it can be drunk now.""";
53;"Brazil,1,310,""This opens with dusty dried-apple aromas. High acidity preserves its composure even though the fruit is marginal and vacillates between flavors of apple and lemony citrus.""";
54;"France,1,3530,""This wine is concentrated and dense. Big tannins flow up through this wine, giving shape to the ripe black fruit. In the back, acidity dominates bright red berries and the potential for a rich, generous future. The wine will age over many years. Drink from 2022.""";
55;"Uruguay,3,540,""Open-grained oak aromas sit on top of dark-berry scents. This blend of Tannat, Merlot and Zinfandel is ripe and beefy on the palate, with jammy weight. Toasty black-fruit flavors are peppery and spicy, while this displays a firm grip on a dark, smoky finish.""";
56;"Argentina,34,9860,""With feline aromas of juniper bush, grass and sweaty citrus, this is true Sauvignon Blanc. Oak aging has lent an easiness to the mouthfeel, which shows good acidity. Flavors of green fruits, melon and pithy bitterness end in chalky clarity. This is one of Argentina's best Sauvignon Blancs.""";
57;"Spain,6,4680,""This wine costs a lot for what it's giving. The nose starts out hard and fruitless, and while the aromas come around, the wine always holds onto its corn and haystack character. Zippy acidity gives the mouth zest, and it also livens up papaya, banana and apricot flavors. Complex and different, but does it taste good enough to justify a $78 price tag?""";
58;"Germany,4,2520,""There's subdued elegance to this dry, lushly textured Riesling. The nose is delicately aromatic with whiffs of stonefruit and smoke that build on the palate. Intensely minerally and bright with lime acidity, it finishes long with a rich, slightly viscous mouthfeel.""";
59;"US,8,22000,""Very polished and pure, if a bit direct and obvious in appeal. A beautiful wine, with pure flavors of currants and cedar. Drinkable now, and should hold through the decade.""";
60;"Bulgaria,4,760,""This white blend of 50% Chardonnay, 30% Sauvignon Blanc and 20% Sémillon has aromas of citrus blossom, vanilla bean and lemongrass. In the mouth it has flavors of lemon curd, lemon-lime zest and mango. The finish is clean with a savory note of dried herbs in the post palate.""";
61;"Spain,3,4350,""Ripe, sweet and stylish, with blackberry, root beer and herb aromas. Bulky yet balanced, with black cherry fruit that comes at you in jammy style. Black tea, ground spices, coffee and raw oak work the finish. A dark and handsome wine, but one that isn't overly complex and is ready to drink now through 2011.""";
62;"Greece,17,3740,""Toast, vanilla and spice on the nose start this elegantly constructed white from, Attica. The wine's lemon and lime flavors are layered with cedar and vanilla notes. An appealing pour with more years to age.""";
63;"France,112,100800,""With its massively concentrated blackberry fruit framed in ample new oak, this bears a bit of resemblance to some Australian Shirazes. It's mouthfilling but supple, with nuances of Christmas spices like cinnamon, clove and anise that linger on the long finish. Drink 2014–2023.""";
64;"Uruguay,1,390,""Clove and barrel spice are dominant factors in this ripe Tannat, from first whiff to the finish. In between, there's char on the nose and palate as well as ripe blackberry and black currant flavors blended with wood-based pepper, nutmeg and more. A smoking, chewy, tannic finish closes this out. Drink from 2016–2019.""";
65;"Hungary,1,460,""This Szamorodni, or late-harvest wine, is amber in color with aromas of caramel and dried raisins. In the mouth, there are rich flavors of dried fruits, stewed plums and wine-soaked raisins that combine on your tongue before a juicy yet persistent finish.""";
66;"England,15,7500,""What an aromatic tease: there is elderflower, tart passion fruit and lots of fruity exuberance. The interplay between lip-smacking tartness and almost frivolous fruit makes for liveliness, excitement and joy. Serve this when you want your guests to sparkle as much as the wine. Autolytic flavors are subtle but provide a creamy finish.""";
67;"France,263,157800,""With up to seven years' bottle aging, this is at a fine point between crispness and a fuller, more mature style. It is ripe with red fruits, cut with acidity and a hint of toastiness. Drink now.""";
68;"France,9,7830,""This rich, delicious wine is still bursting with young apple and grapefruit flavors, giving it a fruity start with great long-term potential. Then the concentration and the richly mineral texture kicks in, lending the wine intensity and the possibility of aging. Drink from 2019.""";
69;"Israel,5,1150,""This is a nicely integrated wine with good balance and structure. Though the finish could be a bit longer, the forward red currant and plum flavors mingling with hints of tomato, tobacco and spice create just enough complexity.""";
70;"Portugal,8,400,""This is a full-bodied and very ripe wine. It is dry, but has layers of sweet fruits, gentle tannins and suggestions of the wood aging. With spice, some herbal character and great fruitiness, it's ready to drink.""";
71;"Germany,10,5700,""Yellow freesia and sweet peach abound in this deeply floral, fruity auslese. Feather light in texture, yet deeply concentrated in flavor, it's penetratingly sweet yet finishes with a flurry of crushed minerals and lime-pith astringency.""";
72;"US,2157,862800,""Zinfandel is joined by Mourvèdre and a few other minor grape varieties in this overtly sweet, high alcohol wine. It's soft and glyceriney, with cherry, blueberry, dark chocolate and pepper flavors. You have to give it credit for being true to its style.""";
73;"US,545,212550,""Youthful and compelling, this 100% estate Merlot comes with a seductive smoky note. The juicy berry flavor is rich and racy, while the barrel aging—50% new—hits exactly the right toasty note.""";
74;"Germany,3,4800,""Viscous, almost oily in texture, this is several vintages older than most of the recent samples, yet seems so unevolved that it's not out of place. Honey and dried spices are the predominant themes, with citrusy fruit making up the core. Should evolve glacially through at least 2025.""";
75;"Argentina,3,150,""While this smells floral and candied, the palate rages, courtesy of strapping acidity that creates tart plum and blueberry flavors.""";
76;"France,1,11000,""Such a generous and ripe wine, with a dark core of tannins surrounded by opulent fruit. Black fruits, coffee, very concentrated flavors, a powerhouse of structure and richness. The warmth of the wine is palpable, as is the aging potential.""";
77;"France,1,2530,""The name refers as much to the brilliant green-gold color of this wine as to its richness. A tiny production from selected parcels of old Marsanne vines, this is a beautifully rich, creamy wine with a touch of honey and flavors of ripe pears.""";
78;"US,156,87360,""You might want to give this intil 2020–2022 in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's pretty tannic, with herb-infused blackberry jam and tea flavors. Frisky acidity is accented by sweet, toasty oak.""";
79;"Canada,12,4800,""This wine still appears to be coming out of its shell, showing some reduction with reticent notes of red plum, cherry and berry. The flavors are lipsmacking and rich, but it's difficult right now to get a clear sense of where it's all going.""";
80;"Italy,62,58900,""You can taste the age here in the wine's sophisticated and evolved aromas of butterscotch, caramel, dried fruit and pressed flower petal. In fact, this wine comes from the far away 2000 vintage but has beautifully maintained its fruit characteristics and overall crispness.""";
81;"Israel,5,500,""With fairly muted fruit flavors and a hint of green pepper, this lighter-bodied and easy-drinking wine will pair well with most meat or chicken entrées. Flash-pasteurized and mevushal, this is a blend of 50% Cab, 30% Merlot and 20% Shiraz.""";
82;"Georgia,5,650,""This pale-straw-colored wine offers aromas of apricot and almond. It has good mouthfeel, smooth tannins, flavors of soft peach, toasted almond, vanilla and freesia, and a finish marked by flavors of almond paste and lemon zest.""";
83;"Portugal,1,4000,""This fabulous wine comes from a legendary Vintage Port year. Aged in wood and only bottled in 2015, it is so concentrated and intense. The old gold and wood flavors are dominant in a beautiful wine that may be old but certainly has every possible nuance of flavor. It is one in a succession of rare and treasured Ports that occasionally emerge from Port producers cellars. Drink now.""";
84;"Greece,4,2200,""This offers aromas and flavors of plum, savory spice and cigarbox, with an overall dry and focused character. A smoky spice note finishes the wine. Pair this with grilled lamb, pizza or steak.""";
85;"Germany,15,7350,""While expressive on the nose with scents of dried cherries, potpourri and spice, the palate on this Pinot Noir is rather savory and austere. Fresh with green herbs and a tart sour-cherry profile, it makes a brisk companion to an array of light meat and game dishes.""";
86;"Canada,6,1680,""Though it's designated as reserve-level, and lists rather high alcohol, this seems thin, stemmy and green. The fruit is nearly invisible. The addition of 14% Cabernet Franc has not had any noticeable impact. Drink up.""";
87;"India,2,200,""Pineapple, grapefruit, and apricot show brightly on the nose and palate. Simultaneously refreshing and sophisticated on the palate, this wine has a crisp, lingering finish laced with flavors of almond blossom.""";
88;"Argentina,33,7920,""This wine leads with big, rubbery, almost stewy aromas. In the mouth, this rich Malbec feels reduced and jammy, with heavy tannins. Flavors of blueberry and blackberry are infused with herbal notes, while the finish offers flavors of licorice and chocolate.""";
89;"Luxembourg,1,260,""This sparkling wine has vanilla bean, freshly baked brioche, Granny Smith apple and Bartlett pear aromas. It has a very nice mousse and flakey pie crust, lemon zest and pear flavors.""";
90;"Portugal,3,1860,""Ripe, rich and smooth, this wine has structure under the generous, opulent black fruits that will allow it to age further. But with its succulent character laced with acidity, it is surprisingly ready to drink for such a young wine.""";
91;"Germany,1,6720,""Honey and smoke mix seductively on this piercingly bright yet intensely rich TBA full of orange marmalade and sweet peach nectar. It's unctuously honeyed but delicately textured on the palate. It's earthy minerality should deepen considerably over the next ten years.""";
92;"Spain,17,7820,""Yeasty aromas of banana and white bread feed into a round full palate that's not at all edgy despite this being brut nature. Bready, yeasty flavors of citrus and nectarine end with a flash of peach and excellent clarity, length and elegance. Both this and AA's Privat Mirgin prove that elevated Cava can compete with the world's best sparkling wines.""";
93;"France,27,31050,""With smoky aromas, this starts out as an enticing wine. On the palate, the fruit is surprisingly soft for a Nuits-St-Georges, with the wine's evident structure showing an open character, edged with wood and red plum and currant flavors. The dry tannins give shape, but do not dominate this big wine.""";
94;"France,1,6020,""Vines planted in the 1960s give this wine its great concentration. With its powerful fruits and dense tannins, it is well structured, with the hallmark bright fruits of the vintage along with acidity. The tannins are very present at the moment, and the wine will need long aging. Drink from 2024.""";
95;"Chile,3,12000,""The price on this wine is laughable, but the quality is excellent. Earthy aromas of lead pencil, baked plum, cassis and black cherry include chocolate and minerality. The palate is rich, jammy and a touch stewy, with herbal blackberry, cassis, chocoalte and coffee flavors. Even more chocolate and licorice rise up on the long finish. Put this away until 2015, then drink through 2024.""";

97;"Brazil,3,1080,""Stony polished white-fruit aromas are lean and clean. This brut nature shows modest heft as it expands on the palate, but mostly this is racy and fit. Yeasty flavors of white pepper and lime finish with a leesy note and stoniness.""";
98;"Chile,14,11200,""With distinct aromas of field herbs, asphalt, gritty mineral, herbal berry and burnt toast, this is a challenging blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Carmenère and Petit Verdot. The palate hits hard with aggressive tannins and abrasive acidity, while flavors of baked black fruits and coconut announce loud oak. This finishes hard and gritty, with a mule's kick.""";
99;"Argentina,1,1020,""This is a potent brew with complexities galore, but there's also a simplicity about it that's appealing. Its raw size is bracing, but the structure and fabric of this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon scream balance. Aromas of lead pencil, sawdust, coconut and brandied cherries introduce briary dark-berry flavors. A long, minty, power-packed finish says lay this down for a few years";
100;"Spain,4,160,""Tropical fruit and citrus aromas aren't bad, but the palate is heavy. The flavor profile only offers soap and grassy white-fruit flavors, while a light, flowery finish falls flat.""";
101;"US,900,234000,""Zippy and fresh, this wine also offers deeper layers of papaya and guava that provide a confectionery complement to the fruit.

105;"New Zealand,6,7200,""This is a sturdy, tannic wine, but one that should come around in a few years. Vanilla, cedar and dark fruit notes have the spotlight for now, with hints of mocha coming on strong on the long finish. Drink 2018–2025.""";
106;"Germany,3,13200,""This stunning TBA is a powerhouse of superripe peach, mango and orange flavors.

Gorgeous now, but should develop an earthy, honeyed intensity over the next decade.""";
107;"France,3,3060,""Very pure lemon and toast flavors dominate this wine. It has crispness, intense freshness and lively acidity. There is also a sense of richness that is slowly developing and that will broaden the wine over the next several months.""";
108;"Hungary,4,680,""This Kekfrankos (known more commonly in Austria as Blaufränkisch) layers tart, crisp blackberry and briar flavors with earthy, rustic notes of wet soil, barnyard and hay. Savory in style and brisk on the palate, it would be a wonderful accompaniment to wild game or fowl.""";
109;"Serbia,2,440,""This aged Riesling is medium gold colored, with pleasant aromas of lemon peel and petrol. It is round and generous on the palate, with flavors of lemon custard and green olive tapenade. The finish is long, with lingering flavors of lemon pith.""";

113;"Portugal,3,2160,""Big, powerful wine that is restrained by its ripe, dusty tannins. It is concentrated, with an almost Port-like texture, a result of the open lagars in which it is fermented. The fruit is likely to be rich and opulent as the tannins move into balance.""";
114;"Spain,40,14400,""Young and fully toasted, with exuberance mellowed by mossy leather aromas. Full-on in the mouth, with piercing tannins in front of a chocolaty, rich palate that's herbal and offers oaky vanilla for sweetness. Turns more herbal and sauvage on the finish.""";

131;"France,2,3860,""This is an attractive, fast-maturing wine with soft tannins, ripe fruits and a juicy, perfumed acidity. It has considerable weight and concentration, along with firm red-plum and berry flavors. It's an elegant wine that should be drunk from 2017.""";
132;"US,69,21390,""With its keen acidity and mineral-dominated flavors, this currently tastes a bit austere. It also has a core of orange, apricot and mango flavors that are sweetened by oak. Don't drink it too cold, and allow it to breathe before consuming.""";
133;"France,10,9400,""While this is currently firm and closed, it promises fine things to come. Weight and richness combine with a solid core of tannins.

Firmly structured, with gripping tannins and concentrated flavors.""";
139;"Italy,93,8370,""You've got to hand it to the folks at this estate: they make nice wines at low prices. This Sicilian Chardonnay is bright and creamy with aromas of orange blossom, almond, golden honey and mature apricot. The wine feels crisp and pristine in the mouth. Very nice.""";

The aftertaste brings grapefruit freshness.""";
143;"Germany,8,4480,""Wisps of smoke and crushed rock imbue this dry, broadly textured wine.

A little more oak was used than in most of the producer's other wines, helping to impart a spicy finish.""";

It's too hard or layered, so get at it soon for its up-front fruit and character.""";
154;"Israel,3,630,""Medium apricot to the eye, this rosé made from Syrah and Mourvèdre opens with a bouquet of strawberry and peach.

404;"Uruguay,21,4200,""This blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay is orange in color and smells neutral except for a note of orange peel. On the palate, this has a grabby skins-driven texture.

The wine will age further, drink until 2020.""";
407;"New Zealand,22,11000,""Toasty, buttery and laced with tropical fruit, this is a full-bodied, fully-oaked Chardonnay that manages to pull all that off with grace and aplomb, thanks to healthy acid levels and admirable concentration. Long on the finish";

412;"Italy,1,6250,""A rich, ripe expression of one of Italy's iconic wines, this displays the heat of the 2011 vintage. It opens with aromas of red currants, tobacco, oak and exotic spice while the full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherries, blueberry extract, licorice and black pepper.

Pleasant notes of smoke and salt linger on the finish.""";
441;"France,34,15980,""With its good bottle age, this bone-dry Champagne from Roederer has gained impressive complexity. The wine is certainly dry, but toast, vanilla and ground almond flavors add to the fruit. The apple skin texture holds this delicious wine together.""";

The mineral flair continues onto the palate, where mandarin orange flavors meet with apple in the midpalate, bound together by a grapefruit pith texture.""";
451;"England,2,700,""Green apple and greengage on the nose turn into white peach and lemon on the palate. The mousse is frothy and lively and there is a wonderful depth to these tart fruit flavors that takes you to juicy, green pastures and white blossom.

456;"France,9,8370,""Wood and fruit balance in this rich and full wine. The yellow and citrus fruits give a good mix of ripeness and a fresher, more mineral character.

459;"New Zealand,29,11600,""This wine shows a fine balance between sweetness (74 g/L) and acidity, reminiscent of a spätlese style.

468;"Hungary,1,110,""While ebulliently floral and fruity with notes of orange blossom and white peach, a bracing hit of lemon balm and lime zest make this bright, brisk Grüner Veltliner especially refreshing. It lingers long on the palate with a bristling minerality.""";
469;"France,1,1940,""Properly opulent, this is a generous, subtly wood-aged wine. Ripe apricot and peach fruits are shot through with crisp apple. The wood and the rich fruits give this structured wine a warm character. It is still young, of course. Drink from 2023.""";

475;"US,198,188100,""You don't have to age this wine—Jarvis did it for you, holding it back more than five years before release, which is a very expensive proposition for a winery. It's a splendid Cabernet, with the tannins soft and velvety.

An impressive effort from this winery—one of Montalcino's little known gems.""";

699;"South Africa,7,2730,""With 14 months in new oak and a whopping 16% alcohol, you might think this wine is going to be too big and over the top, but while it's ripe and rich it's also well made and balanced. Berry preserves mixed with fennel seeds and coffee grinds dominate the profile, with a solid black pepper kick to keep things lively on the lengthy finish.""";
700;"Peru,3,300,""Hot and leathery up front, with stewy notes and candied red fruit aromas. The palate features smacking tannic bite along with foxy-tasting red fruit. Turns medicinal on the finish.""";
701;"New Zealand,1,70,""Costco's private-label Sauvignon Blanc is priced right and offers a fruity mouthful of melon and gooseberry flavor. The citrusy finish is a bit short, but pleasant.""";
702;"Germany,1,1770,""This wine reeks of intensity, from its powerful aromas of musk and dried pineapple to its somewhat monolithic honeyed fruit flavors and enormous sugar levels. It's impressively concentrated—enough to stand up to almost any dessert you choose to throw at it.""";
703;"Italy,21,10710,""Underbrush, dark spice, mature berry and balsamic notes emerge in the glass. The chewy palate doles out juicy Marasca cherry, black raspberry and licorice flavors with a hint of pipe tobacco, while youthfully firm, seasoned tannins provide the framework. Drink 2019–2017.""";
704;"Austria,7,5460,""The first vintage at Nikolaihof from this vineyard, the wine is off dry. There is a lively fruit character and green apple skins, along with a creamy, fresh aftertaste.""";
705;"Greece,7,1890,""Toasted nut, rhubarb, pepper and spice box aromas abound on the nose of this plucky red. Black cherry, spice and pepper flavors follow. Clean, spicy and food friendly, this selection is ageable and assertive.""";
706;"Argentina,2,4600,""This immense Cabernet contains 3% Malbec, and it's about as ripe and raisiny as a wine can get while still holding onto a semblance of balance. Aromas of raisin and baked blackberry blend with rooty cola and vanilla notes. This feels heavy to the point of syrupy, while flavors of prune, mocha and blueberry finish chunky, with low acidity. Drink through 2019.""";
707;"Italy,1,1140,""Dense and richly structured, this opens with black cherry, rose, leather and asphalt aromas. The concentrated palate offers succulent black cherry, crushed red raspberry, orange peel, sage, toasted oak, espresso and vanilla alongside brisk acidity. Astringent wood tannins leave the mouth feeling dried out. Drink after 2018.""";
708;"Australia,3,5550,""This rich, opulent wine carries its massive oak load easily, marrying vanilla and toasted coconut notes with ripe plum and black cherry flavors. It's full bodied and plush, with supple tannins supported by the wood. Give it a few years to knit together and drink it 2020–2030.""";
709;"Germany,1,1260,""Spice and lanolin notes are curious and enticing on the nose and palate of this sunny and sweet, but impeccably balanced Riesling. Juicy, supple, apple jelly and quince flavors are offset by striking acidity and steely minerality that reverberate on the finish.""";
710;"France,4,4560,""This dense wine is still very young. The fruit still needs to express itself in a wine that is broad and ripe. Give this rich wine, with its creamy texture and touches of spice from wood aging, until 2021.""";
711;"Italy,4,200,""Terrale translates as “product of the earth,” and that’s about all one can say about this wine. The grapes used are Catarrato, a white variety indigenous to Sicily, and the ubiquitous Trebbiano. A light apple nose starts it off, and the structure is good, with adequate acids. However, the finish is short and lacks flavor.""";
712;"Spain,1,2250,""Old wines are not easy to appreciate, so we'd almost rather have you judge this wine. In our opinion, it's way too sour and lacking in fruit to justify rave reviews. Thirty years of age doesn't seem to have helped it, and what's left is sherried and pruny, yet with sharp acidity.""";
713;"Brazil,2,460,""Yeasty briny aromas are a bit pickled and not very fruity. This rosé feels yeasty and not very tight or expressive. Flavors of tropical fruits and melon don't change much on a quick-passing finish.""";
714;"Germany,43,14620,""Wisps of smoke and crushed stones lend complexity to fresh apple and pear notes on this delicate, lace-textured wine. Electric lemon-line acid strikes a mean chord on the palate, but hints of sweet peach and apricot even out the finish.""";
715;"Argentina,3,1620,""The nose on this Malbec is loaded with oak and pencil eraser aromas";
716;"South Africa,6,3300,""This is a ripe, sweet and immediately attractive dessert wine, with forward aromas and flavors of dried apricot, golden raisin, papaya, honeycomb and gingered orange. Hints of sweet spice and toasted nuts unfold on the long close. It's viscous and lush, but with ample acidity to lift the finish. Drink now–2018.""";
717;"Greece,15,2100,""White flowers and peach start this slightly simple but good white from Greece. On the palate, lemon and orange flavors join with a honeyed spice. The overall character is balanced and friendly.""";
718;"Uruguay,1,1200,""Ignore the crazy price on this aged Tannat and enjoy the overall high quality of this Uruguayan bruiser. Sun-baked, minty, earthy aromas scream “warm-climate” wine, while the palate is chunky in feel, with some hardness. Flavors of rich, stewed berries, tons of oak, related spice and earth notes finish hefty but with minimal stuffing. Drink now.""";
719;"Georgia,5,700,""Smooth and supple, with loads of juicy, ripe blackberry and plum flavors, this full-bodied, luscious red is another great bang-for-your-buck Georgian offering. Big, bold tannins persist on the palate that's laced with tasty, lingering notes of coffee and dark chocolate. Perfect with winter braises and stews.""";
720;"Hungary,1,7640,""Surprisingly subtle, yet maddeningly complex, this is a rare treat to unravel slowly, sip by sip. Sweet and honeyed on the nose with scents of freesia, orange peel and stone fruit, but accented with just a hint of sun-dried hay. The palate is deeply concentrated with undulating waves of honey, beeswax and fruit, but balanced with striking tangerine acidity. Remarkably long on the finish.""";
721;"Lebanon,1,500,""Plum, red berry, cinnamon and mint aromas give this savory-style red from Lebanon a serious start. Soft and elegant on the palate but with a touch of spice and lively acid, the wine is balanced and unfolding, and will pair well with dishes that offer complex spice. An interesting red with exotic appeal.""";
722;"France,13,32500,""Under the regime of Gérard Perse, Pavie seems to have become more opulent, more extracted, and, dare I say it, more simplistic. The richness of the 2000 vintage lends itself to this technique. While it is a wonderful, immediately appealing wine, with its intense dark fruits, it seem to lack the complexity of other wines of similar status.""";
723;"Israel,3,1590,""Deep red-violet to the eye, this wine has a well-defined nose of blueberry pie and flint. There is a good mix of tart fruit and spice, with flavors of blueberry, cranberry, black pepper, anise and smoked meat cavorting amidst very soft tannins. The smooth finish is characterized by flavors of smoke and orange zest.""";
724;"Italy,41,25420,""Underbrush, grilled porcini mushroom, leather and ripe dark berry aromas lead the nose on this hearty red. On the firmly structured palate, notes of graphite, ground pepper, smoke and tobacco accent a core of ripe black cherry while fine-grained tannins provide support.""";
725;"France,2,3680,""While there are still plenty of firm tannins, the wine also is now showing its red berry fruits and enticing texture. Great acidity cuts through the structure, giving freshness to the naturally dense character of this Grand Cru wine. It's for aging, but not for too long, so drink from 2017.""";
726;"Canada,1,830,""A real oddball that's musky, melony, sweet and–yes–bubbly. Vidal is a French-American hybrid with some strange petrolly aromatics that take some getting used to, and they're well-displayed in this example that gets its bubbles from fermentation in sealed tanks, trapping the naturally occurring carbon dioxide.""";
727;"Germany,54,22680,""Upfront aromas of smoke and spring ramps subside to reveal delicate apple blossom notes on this honeyed, medium-sweet wine. Ripe, rich yellow peach and cantaloupe flavors flood the palate, yet wrap up remarkably dry with a lingering finish that's intense with minerality. It's gorgeously styled, yet elegant and dainty.""";
728;"South Africa,137,13700,""With 11,000 cases imported, this crisp, clean Steen should be easy to find and well worth the price. Light weight but filled with ripe pineapple and Key lime flavors accented by crushed white flowers. Drink now.""";
729;"France,11,28600,""This rich wine balances ripe yellow fruits with intense citrus acidity in a harmonious whole. Its structure is laden with minerality, toast and a smooth, delicious creamy aftertaste.""";
730;"France,1,2220,""This is a beautifully balanced, elegant and mature sparkler. There is fruit—ripe strawberry—but the main character is its fine balance and richness. It can age, though it is at its best now.""";
731;"Hungary,2,740,""Sauska's premiere bottling, the Cuvée 11 has a hefty dose of Cabernet Franc, giving it a distinct spice and bramble character. It's not a dainty wine at 15% abv, but the palate is clean with focused red fruit accented by fresh herbs and balanced tannins.""";
732;"Israel,23,4600,""With aromas of cherry and lavender, this inky garnet-colored wine delivers flavors of blackberry, black plum, eucalyptus, anisette and iodine with a touch of salinity. There is a nice interplay of fruit and cooling herb flavors amid firm tannins that come to a head in a minty finish. Mevushal.""";
733;"Italy,1,2520,""Nebbiolo grapes, with their naturally elegant aromas of black currant and licorice, speak loudly. So does winery magic: Tones of spice, leather, cola and tobacco are derived from 24 months of careful oak aging. The tannins are fine and tight and this wine will age ten years or more.""";
734;"US,20,50000,""Very rich and opulent, in the Heidi Barrett style, this Cabernet is sweetly jammy but somewhat direct in blackberries, cherries and raspberries. The finish is extraordinarily long and spicy, an indication that it's a wine for the cellar. Firm tannins and fine acidity confirm its ageability. Hold this flashy, decadent wine until 2016 and then try it again.""";
735;"Germany,1,70,""Vanilla and spice aromas lend confectionery notes to this soft, slightly syrupy red wine. Sweet and fleshy on the palate, it's light in alcohol and acidity. The finish is marked by fine but rigid tannins.""";
736;"US,7,5880,""This is a mix of 56% Sagemoor and 41% Champoux Cabernet, with a 3% splash of estate Petit Verdot. It's detailed in the manner of a Pauillac, thick cassis fruit with deep veins of iron, cedar, licorice and a just a hint of silage. The fruit is dark and dense, but with breathing you'll find it begins to open into a splendid blend of black cherry, cassis and mountain berry flavor. Woodward Canyon's red wines age beautifully, but if drunk young give them a lot of breathing time.""";
737;"Argentina,1,720,""This is textbook juice for the cellar. A cool, herbal nose turns cedary and stout. It's wall-to-wall tannins now, with complex flavors of red fruits mingling with tomato leaf, oregano, spice and tobacco (reflections of the 40% Cabernet Sauvignon that goes with more familiar Malbec). A bullish finish with mild green notes should soften with aging. Drink from 2014 to 2021.""";
738;"France,1,2050,""Very dense wine, its tannins solid and concentrated. The structure is the leader here, with the young fruit showing through as black plum skins and crushed strawberries. This is a firmly tannic wine, needing aging.""";
739;"Germany,1,840,""The Thanisch wines from the Doctor vineyard rarely stand out in our magazine's blind tastings, making their value proposition questionable. That said, this is a finely elegant wine, with floral details on the nose and enduring stony notes on the finish that mark it as something special. At only 7.5% abv, you'd expect an intensely sweet wine, but the sugars are amply buffered by acids and minerality, so the overall impression is one of richness without excessive weight rather than sugary sweetness.""";
740;"England,5,2250,""The nose tells of the crisp green freshness of tart apples, the palate counters this with more generous, riper but still very fresh fruit and a wonderfully balm-like creaminess. It all comes together on the midpalate: rounded but unobtrusive autolysis embraces the tart briskness and rounds it all out. Totally refreshing, and does not take itself too seriously.""";
741;"Italy,11,33000,""Spicy and supple, this has aromas of cured meat, white pepper, toast and dark plum that follow the warm robust palate along with dried black cherry, coffee and licorice. Round tannins provide the supple framework. Drink through 2020.""";
742;"Greece,1,340,""Cinnamon, vanilla, coffee and red berries on the nose are followed by flavors of pepper, cinnamon and forest berries in this plucky Syrah. Spicy with a spin of tart fruit, the wine nevertheless has a full-bodied feel.""";
743;"Germany,1,2790,""Very honeyed and sweet, with bold flavors of apricot and mango that seem almost caramelized in their sugary intensity. Drink now and over the next few years.""";
744;"France,8,8720,""With its potent mixture of intense fruit and equally concentrated structure, this wine is an obvious candidate for long-term aging. Showing ripe yellow fruit, almond hints and a strong mineral texture, it will develop slowly and be best from 2022. This vineyard, one of the most familiar of Puligny-Montrachet's premier crus, is also one of the highest on the slope.""";
745;"Germany,1,2280,""Von Schubert bottled two eisweins from the Herrenberg in 2009. This one is pale in color, with intense pineapple and honey flavors. The wine is sweet, luscious and viscous yet never cloying, with a long finish that features unfolding layers of fruit flavor.""";
746;"Germany,1,1010,""While 1976 in Germany was a benchmark vintage, known for ripe, intensely flavored Rieslings, this auslese feels frail and faded at nearly 39 years old. Still, it offers a fascinating glimpse at Riesling's intensely mineral character, once the ebullience of its fruit and perfume have faded. Tasting now only a touch off dry, it's intensely dusty, saline and mineral, with a lean, slightly astringent finish.""";
747;"France,4,7400,""This wine has power along with great fruit and a rich structure. Yellow fruits are laced with a more finessed texture that adds minerality. It is a dense wine, full of fruit, with a measured touch of wood. Age this until 2021.""";
748;"Italy,1,2590,""Poggio di Sotto has steadily worked over the years to produce extremely elegant and polished expressions of Brunello that show the best of the local territory. Candied fruit, smoke, light shadings of licorice and tobacco, crushed mineral and white pepper appear on the bouquet. But there's just enough fresh cherry fruit to make your mouth pucker.""";
749;"South Africa,28,6160,""With 16 months in French and American oak, it should not be a surprise that this wine is as rich and wonderfully wood-spiced as it is. Earthy spice by way of clove, cinnamon sticks, anise root and cigar box bring the typical dark fruit flavors to another level. Balanced and drinkable now with a finish reminiscent of a tanned hide.""";
750;"Greece,28,3640,""Tobacco, black pepper and allspice lead this accessible red blend from Elios. On the palate, cheerful red berry and raspberry flavors are both smooth and friendly, with a touch of tobacco spice to add kick. Pair with grilled lamb, pizza.""";
751;"France,1,3690,""Every Burgundy merchant seems to have a Clos de Vougeot. The Aegerter's version is relatively light, as much fruit as tannins even while it is young. Berry fruits comes forward, while the layer of tannin is in a supporting role. It's a solid wine, not one that has a long future. Drink from 2018.""";
752;"Spain,1,980,""Gorgeous from head to toe, this opens with cedar, maple, blackberry and the essence of schisty minerality. On the palate, it's tannic and firm but not overpowering. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, fig and vanilla finish with chocolaty notes and more than enough leftover berry fruit. Hold until 2017, then drink through 2024.""";
753;"Croatia,9,1170,""Yellow freesias, fresh apples and quince preserves perfume this lovely, medium-bodied Malvasia from Istria. Dry on the palate yet elegantly fruity, it balances bright, fresh apple and tangerine flavors with nervy acidity and a lemon pith astringency on the finish.""";
754;"Australia,2,6000,""This wine is dark brown in hue with a greenish-gold tint to its rim, providing clues to its advanced age. The aromas are nutty, with mossy notes of rancio filled out by sweet flavors of dried dates and figs. It's full bodied and unctuous in texture, without being overblown or heavy on the palate. The intense finish lingers forever—or at least until you give in and take another sip.""";
755;"Spain,4,10000,""This black-colored, opaque bruiser is as concentrated as wine gets before crossing the line. Aromas of gritty black fruits are amped up, while the palate pounds with extraction and tannins. Huge flavors of blackberry and cassis finish with more muscle than finesse. This is ultra ripe Graciano and Petit Verdot that nobody would describe as shy. Drink through 2020.""";
756;"England,2,1020,""An appetizing mix of oatmeal and tart apple fills the nose. The fizzy palate boosts apple and rhubarb flavors and spells total refreshment and verve. These notions are underpinned by soft, biscuity notes of autolysis, always circling back to juicy, crisp apple. If you want refreshment, look no further.""";
757;"Bulgaria,1,400,""Not your typical Malbec, this Bulgarian version has aromas of tobacco leaf and cassis, and flavors of tart cherry and red plum. It offers soft tannins and a finish filled with tastes of red fruits.""";
758;"Spain,4,18000,""This is the granddaddy in the Emilio Moro portfolio, but the wine is so ripe and oaky it's syrupy-smelling. Maximum ripeness means it's a bit Port-like on the palate, with baked black-fruit flavors that finish soft and jammy. This brims with power, extraction and flavor but it's grasping for structure. Drink through 2019.""";
759;"US,9,8640,""This is an austere, elegant study in power and grace, blending 53% Merlot with 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc. Substantial and tannin-defined as many of its brethren of this vintage, it shows cedar, pencil shavings and a touch of tobacco, more savory than fruit-driven. Drink now through 2023.""";
760;"France,7,5320,""This wine is initially austere, but then shows rich, ripe fruit and a solid structure. The wine's strong tannic character suggests considerable aging potential, while it already shows a deliciously gentle side.""";
761;"Argentina,2,1180,""Until now, Tapiz has been a value-driven brand with no wine priced above $20. This outstanding Malbec shows that they've been holding something back. Black Tears is ripe and handsome, with almost everything in its perfect place. It's a hard-driving wine with blackberry, vanilla and coconut aromas and flavors in front of a chewy, tannin-rich finish with the mildest note of raisin. Drink this unbridled stud now through 2017.""";
762;"Mexico,2,360,""The color is appropriately light, the aromas appropriately floral and rose-like. Fleshy cherry flavors are balanced by a helping of greens and flowers. Light and elegant. Who would've thought Nebbiolo like this could come from Mexico?""";
763;"Italy,723,180750,""Young and racy, this has aromas of moist earth, red berry and chopped aromatic herb. The tangy, light-bodied palate offers strawberry, sour cherry, orange peel and a touch of clove alongside firm acidity and refined tannins. It cries out for food and would pair well with hearty pasta dishes topped with thick tomato-based sauces and savory soups.""";
764;"Luxembourg,2,460,""This Riesling has white floral and lemon zest aromas and lemon pith and grapefruit flavors. It's nicely balanced, with a pleasantly tart finish.""";
765;"Italy,26,17160,""Vibrant aromas suggest violet, rose, vineyard dust, aromatic herb and perfumed berry. The palate delivers crunchy red cherry, black raspberry, licorice and baking spice alongside firm but polished tannins. It's still young but well balanced and intense with bright acidity. Drink 2018–2030.""";
766;"Canada,8,3600,""This special-edition wine carries a striking logo relating to a particular chair that has something to do with the owners. Apart from that, it's pretty standard stuff—black cherry, plum and cocoa flavors with a definite green edge. It finishes tannic and chewy with a bit of alcoholic heat.""";
767;"France,1,7670,""This is finely structured, a tense wine with great fruits and an intense texture. It's tight while bursting with fruit. The structure is complex, dense and very mineral in character. It is a wine that will need many years, so drink from 2022. The production is tiny, and what is not fit for this wine goes into the Dillon Clarté wine.""";
768;"Australia,4,6000,""This is a top example of the classic Australian blend. Cabernet (57%) provides cigar box aromas and elongates the finish, while Shiraz (43%) fills out the midpalate. The combination is full-bodied yet muscular, generous yet firmly structured. Essence of cassis is framed by hints of vanilla and cedar, while the long finish shows off chewy tannins and mouthwatering acids. Drink 2023–2035, and posssibly beyond.""";
769;"Israel,2,2000,""Produced only in outstanding vintages, this rich Bordeaux blend exudes fantastic flavors of black plum, blackberry and black cherry accented by notes of tobacco and white pepper.

The solid structure and assertive backbone ensure this wine will be a pleasure now and for years to come. Imported by Yarden Inc.""";
770;"Argentina,54,4320,""Yellow and chunky, and definitely on the way toward the grave. Mustardy aromas are severely short on freshness, and the palate is just as flat, dull and mealy as the nose. A weird, low-acid blend of Chardonnay, Viognier and Chenin Blanc.""";
771;"Germany,1,1430,""Sweet and bracingly tart at the same time, with racy acidity framing sweet orange and lime flavors. Flourishes of bergamot and cinnamon add complexity on the nose and reprise on the long finish.""";
772;"Italy,9,8820,""This is a stunning and vibrant Barolo that defies the heat of the vintage thanks to 47-year-old vines, amazing terroir and noninvasive winemaking. It shows floral aromas of violet layered with spice and truffle, while the palate delivers rich wild cherry, mint and cinnamon. This already shows excellent complexity, but it's still young. Drink after 2022.""";
773;"Israel,4,1560,""This is a balanced and complex fifty-fifty blend, with herbal accents of licorice root, coffee bean and foliage that mingle harmoniously with ripe fruit notes of blackberry, wild raspberry and cherry.

776;"France,86,41280,""With the first hints of maturity on the nose, this is already a rounded and steely wine. The fruit shows as spiced apples and black currants, cut with intense citrus.

777;"Slovenia,2,540,""This Slovenian Cabernet Sauvignon has aromas of bramble, pencil lead and red plum. It is soft on entry into the mouth with flavors of black plum, black raspberry and a soft, sweet tannic finish.""";
778;"Chile,1,620,""Dark and earthy up front, with aromas of blackberry, hard spices and fresh tomato. The palate is jammy and deep, with brimming tannins supporting earthy, woodsy flavors of blackberry, moss and licorice. Flattens out somewhat on the finish, turning heavier and more rich. Drink over the next two years.""";
779;"Spain,2,1580,""This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend from the south-of-Madrid area represents no designated region other than Spain. It's an intense blend with aromas of blackberry, pepper, toasted oak and smokiness.

780;"Macedonia,2,320,""This Merlot-Cabernet-Vranec blend offers an appealing, easydrinking array of warming spice, dark berries and spice on the nose and palate. Full in the mouth with a fruity character backed by acid and spice, it will pair well with veal or pork.""";
781;"Spain,224,24640,""Young and bouncy, and that's to be expected from this type of juvenile Tempranillo. However, should you like full-fruit young wines with force and no oak, it's not at all bad. Expect juicy black cherry and other runaway flavors.""";
782;"Germany,1,970,""Pretty flavors of pink grapefruit and stone fruit are cloaked in rich swathes of fennel, honey, petrol and spice on this expressive, penetrating wine. Sweet-tasting and juicy, it bristles with streaks of acidity and astringency. It's already showing its stripes, but it should be even more exciting in five years.""";
783;"France,61,32940,""With vineyards in the southern vineyards of the Aube, Vincent Couche makes a rich style of Champagne. This 2002 vintage, now maturing well, is ripe—almost opulent—in character.

784;"Spain,1,1360,""A more intense version of Carraovejas's Reserva from 2012, this also includes more than 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Thus it's spicy and prickly on the nose, with road tar and peppery notes in addition to potent berry fruit. A rich saturated rumbling palate deals coffee, toast, blackberry and herbal flavors that are much like the Reserva but more amplified. A charred finish has a lemony ring to it. Drink from 2020 through 2030.""";
785;"South Africa,4,1640,""Focused flavors of mint and black currant come together in this distinctive Cabernet. There's a touch of oak too that adds spice, and the overall character is elegant. The wine will benefit from some aging to further integrate its parts.""";

787;"Israel,2,580,""This wine is dark garnet to the eye, with a fragrance of raspberry, cherry and Mediterranean herbs. There is a pleasing balance of fruit and dried herb notes.

788;"France,11,19800,""With all the signature acidity of the 1996 vintage, this shows plenty of aging potential. The wine is thirst-quenchingly fresh, with the flavor of just-squeezed lime juice, but also has a depth of complex tannins and texture. Drink now but age for five years or more.""";

For now, the potential is all evident in the tremendous length on the finish.""";
790;"Uruguay,1,370,""Grassy, leathery aromas lack ripeness and concentration. In the mouth, this is high in acidity, with rough tannins. Leathery, lightly weedy plum and currant flavors finish herbal. This Tannat puts up noticeable green notes on the nose, palate and finish.""";

Verve and freshness are kept only in slight check by a phenolic backbone and are driven on by the linear lemon freshness. While totally compelling now, the wine will become even more intriguing with bottle age. Drink 2015–2020.""";
797;"Chile,1,1030,""Dark, toasty and minerally to start with, then throw in some olive, herb and cassis and it's pure Maipo Cabernet at its best.

Ready to drink but could be cellared for another 4–5 years.""";

Rich, dark fruit aromas and flavors of cherry, plum and boysenberry are handsomely graced by spicy tones of licorice, black pepper and wood spice.

817;"Brazil,1,300,""Briny grassy aromas of apple and citrus are yeasty as well. This Chardonnay-Pinot Noir blend is foamy and active, while flavors run towards slightly bitter and yeasty, with fruit hard to find. A similar finish renders this good but with issues.""";

834;"Portugal,3,2550,""This deeply impressive blend of 20 different varieties comes from a vineyard at the top of the Gaivosa estate that was oddly ignored for many years. With black plum fruit, dense tannins and intense acidity, it's built for longterm aging. Drink from 2021.""";

842;"Australia,1,840,""Perhaps the best young wine I've tasted from Margaret River, this makes a compelling case for the region's Cabernet. Pure cassis fruit is lifted and framed by hints of toasted cedar, making for soaring aromatics and flavors, but what sets this wine apart is the tender, silky texture married to ample weight and richness. The finish lingers, with a supple, dreamy character that speaks to a gentle climate and careful winemaking. Drink now–2030.""";

849;"Chile,160,14400,""Young and grapy, with plenty of heavily toasted oak, this is one Chilean red that could use a year or so to settle down. Right now the fruit is just too unformed and the charred oak too unintegrated, but the solid raw materials should knit together nicely in a relatively short time.""";
850;"Chile,40,8400,""Your first take on this heavily oaked, natural-yeast Chard is that it's a three-alarm smoke alert. Few, if any, Chilean Chardonnays are this overtly oaky. But the wood is of high quality, and the more time you give it the more you find apple, citrus and spice. Yes, it's still resiny. But the balance and natural character of the wine are very good. Best if you like a New World style with plenty of barrel character.""";
851;"Argentina,13,10400,""Winemakers Hélène Garcin and Patrice Levêque have coaxed a ton of character from 70-year-old Malbec and Cabernet vines, and the result is juicy but dark, with asphalt and tar aromas sitting in front of tight but generous black fruit (cassis and blackberry). Finishing notes of coffee, mocha and char leave you happy.""";

853;"US,19,12730,""With its big, hard tannins, this is one for the cellar. There's a certain austerity that suggests the rocky soils of this mountain vineyard. But the fruit, packed into a dense core, is ripe and suggestive of blackberry and cherries. The youthful brawniness softens after some time in the glass or decanter, but you're best off aging it until 2019 or so.""";
854;"Spain,2,2240,""Very nice red wine but for $112 we want to be forced to take notice, and frankly that doesn't really happen here. Still, the wine goes snap, crackle and pop on both the bouquet and palate. It's a crisp one, with live-wire cherry, cola and spice flavors. Not at all flabby, and instead runs lean and fresh. Good now and maybe better in a few more years.""";
855;"Spain,536,80400,""Young, rambunctious Toro is what this is. It's leathery and raw on the nose, with barrel char to boot. The palate is sweet, unctuous and creamy, with candied berry flavors and caramel. And the tannins are typically huge and grabby.""";

866;"France,2,4480,""The estate is located to the north west of the village of Fleurie, further into the hills. The wine is structured and tannic with layers of red berries and tight acidity. It will need to soften for a few months, so drink from late 2017.""";
867;"Austria,23,11270,""Yeasty citrus notes dominate the nose while the palate is savory with chervil, sage and more yeast. A vein of crisp citrus acidity pulls it all together. The aftertaste lingers long with lemon zest.""";
868;"Argentina,19,19000,""While the nose on this muscular Malbec is lush, ripe and minty, there's also a grounding, complex scent of graphite.

Drink through 2019.""";
869;"France,4,32000,""This isn't sweet, but just so wonderfully rich. It's the concentration of botrytis that makes the wine. The texture is velvet, but with a spicy bite to it. Apricot, honey and marzipan all contribute to a wine that will age over decades.""";
870;"Spain,1,1130,""Upon opening, this smells oaky and lemony, although airing brings it around. Fresh and mildly astringent on the palate, this tastes oaky and briny at first, then more complex, deep and toasty as it spreads out.

Flavors of vanilla, raw oak, tomato, plum, herbs and chocolate are complex and finish with multiple interest points along with mild heat. Give this more time, if possible. Best from 2018 through 2022.""";
894;"Georgia,1,230,""Don't be fooled by this honey-colored wine's simple nose of clementine. It offers a complex palate of green apple, guava and honeydew melon bolstered by soft floral notes. Strong tannins make their presence known on the gums and tongue, but any sense of grippiness is overcome by the bright citrus finish.""";
895;"France,2,4200,""The success of this wine owes as much to Merlot as to Cabernet. The Merlot has created the ripeness and smoothness of the wine. While the Cabernet keeps it firm and closed up, there is a base of rich, sweet fruit here that will show over the next two years. The style of the wine is moving away from elegance to power under the new regime of owners, Champagne Roederer.""";
896;"Israel,1,520,""This wine has a bouquet of cassis, violet and black pepper. Well-integrated flavors of cassis, strawberry preserves, anise, fennel bulb and lavender are set amid silky tannins that feel as if they may go on forever but are surpassed at the finish when fruit flavors pull out all the stops.""";
897;"Argentina,252,50400,""Yeasty aromas indicate that early oxidation is setting in on this blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc. A lean palate with sizzling malic acid but little body deals bready flavors of generic white fruits. Oxidized flavor notes return on the finish.""";

899;"Brazil,4,480,""This Brazilian Merlot smells rubbery and gaseous, with saucy berry notes. In the mouth, this is severely tannic and drying. Toasty, blackened and bitter in flavor, this ends with peppery notes and hard-pounding tannins.""";
900;"Uruguay,1,110,""Warm earthy berry aromas are mostly solid. This Tannat has a fresh rubbery mouthfeel and dark peppery flavors of mixed black fruits. The finish deals chocolate, coffee and spice notes. For entry-level Uruguayan Tannat, this is a good one.""";
901;"Argentina,2,1380,""Ripe, warm aromas of leather, licorice and baked black plum are the greeting on this Malbec-led blend. In the mouth, it's extracted, jammy and moderately tannic.

902;"Italy,465,279000,""You'll find ripe plum, forest floor, exotic spice, menthol and espresso aromas in this structured red.

903;"France,1,2380,""With its structured, mineral character, this is a serious, ageworthy wine. It has a sense of coiled power and steel and a dense, complex texture that brings out both its ripe, pure fruit character and its intensity. Age this wine for at least 5–8 years.""";
904;"France,255,28050,""With the typical blend of a Côtes de Provence rosé, this is pale in color and light at heart.

A touch of tannin in the structure gives it an attractive tension as well as a tangy aftertaste.""";
905;"Mexico,5,1150,""This has aromas of smashed berry and red licorice candy. It feels raspy and resiny, with flavors of toasted oak and jammy blueberry and raspberry. It's wiry and lacking finesse on the finish.""";
906;"Australia,1,1080,""This wine ticks all the boxes, but just lacks the excitement and drama to take it to the next level. Smoke and vanilla notes add interest to the juicy, easy-to-drink cassis fruit. There's ample but not too much weight on the palate. Supple tannins. Perhaps it just needs additional cellaring time to warrant the price, although it doesn't come across as needing it in the structural sense.""";
907;"Chile,2,1380,""This comes across as the best Don Melchor that Concha y Toro has produced, and at $69 it should be. It's very ripe, with oak sitting atop pure cassis and plum aromas.

910;"Italy,8,20000,""Underbrush, truffle, stewed plum and toasted aromas come together in the glass. The packed, densely concentrated palate offers raisin, blackberry jam, pipe tobacco, baking spice and dark bitter chocolate framed in bracing, close-grained tannins that still need to unwind.

911;"South Africa,14,2940,""This wine has a fresh, spicy green character on the nose: green pepper, mint, plum, cherry. Dark fruit flavors mingled with mint and smoke offer complexity on the palate. The wine is assertive but pretty. Pair with tangy grilled meats or stew.""";
912;"US,21,47250,""Voluptuously smooth, this wine is dark and brambly in tangy blackberry and black currant, offering a length and breadth of texture and big flavor. Earthy, with accents of cedar, it has a toasted oak flavor that adds to the complexity and intrigue.""";
913;"Italy,14,12880,""This traditionally styled Barolo has a classic fragrance of violet, rose and leather, with balsamic notes.

914;"Germany,7,4550,""While sprightly and lean in style, this dry, mineral-tinged Riesling seems to round out on the palate, building in ripe white-peach and grapefruit flavors. Penetrating lemon-lime acidity wins out on the finish, along with a pleasant bite of citrus zest.""";

Spicy, long and elegant on the finish, this is the real deal. Drink through 2021.""";
917;"Portugal,4,5000,""Toffee and vanilla aromas give an intensely sweet, molasses and caramel flavored wine in an almost syrup-like consistency. It is very ripe, with some honey, balanced with a surprisingly fresh citrus character.""";
918;"Germany,9,4770,""This complex wine manages to combine dry minerality and sweet fruit in an interesting way. There's a briny note similar to crushed shells on the nose, but also bright cherry aromas, while on the palate an extra note of honey creeps in, imparting sweetness and length on the finish.""";
919;"Mexico,1,580,""The bouquet on this blend of Cab, Zin, Merlot and Tempranillo is fairly smooth and complex, with spice and modest heat.

920;"US,2,10000,""This is a hugely structured and concentrated wine, the double plusses marked on barrel selections meant to call out the best of the best.

It's sturdy, layered and balanced, with a hint of smoke from aging 18 months in a mix of French and American oak.""";

It's harmonious, hitting that intersection of freshness and richness perfectly and finishing long.""";
940;"Greece,5,1800,""White flowers, lemon peel and vanilla lead this elegant white. Though the wine's tropical fruit flavors are forward, its minerality and spice give it grounding. This is a very good everyday white perfect for grilled chicken and heartier vegetable dishes.""";

992;"Portugal,1,1940,""This magnificent wine is rich and intense with toffee and rare spice flavors. It is so concentrated— old gold in character and color with acidity that cuts through the sweetness and makes the wine so beautifully concentrated and crisp at the same time. Drink now.""";
993;"US,102,47940,""You'll love the brightness and liveliness of this wonderfully drinkable Cabernet. Sometimes these rich wines can be heavy, but this one combines tartness with its elaborate blackberry jam, anise and cedar wood flavors, which makes it sing. Perfect now with a great steak, and should age well for up to eight years.""";
994;"Spain,1,2200,""Smoky berry, lemon peel, graphite and huge black-fruit aromas provide a stellar opening. Raw tannins and staunchness create a powerful palate that needs time to mellow out.

995;"France,45,58500,""With its mature orange, onion skin color, this is a soft, toasty wine. It is losing fruit and gaining a wide range of mature flavors while keeping tight acidity.

996;"Mexico,4,600,""This oaky wine opens with a huge pop of toasty, burnt aromas. It's resiny feeling, with a creamy palate. Hard time spent in Hungarian barrels has resulted in flavors of toasty apple, cinnamon and peppery spices. This lacks harmony.""";
997;"Spain,9,5580,""With a burnished gold tint, this oak-aged, mature Godello offers dry citrus aromas, hard spice and barrel notes.

1013;"Spain,416,41600,""Zingy and sort of floral on the nose, but fairly pickled, less than pure fruit mars the flavor profile. White wine from La Mancha has never been a Spanish strong suit, and while this wine isn't cloying, sharp or dead on arrival, it doesn't add up to much.""";
1014;"Australia,1,2300,""From vines planted in 1893, this is an inky, concentrated Shiraz. The aromas hint at cracked pepper, vanilla and blueberries, while on the palate, this is superripe and full bodied.

1015;"France,1,2070,""Named after the French king who first said that Champagne had to be bottled (thereby allowing the bubbles to be retained), this dry rosé is rich, beginning to mature and full of ripe red fruits.

1092;"Italy,4,7800,""The nose is still a bit closed but eventually reveals black-skinned berry, dark spice, iris and a whiff of tilled soil. The palate is more expressive and downright delicious, offering juicy black cherry, raspberry jam, cinnamon and a touch of exotic spice. Firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework while a licorice note closes the lingering finish. Drink 2020–2032.""";
1093;"France,2,9380,""Still young but already impressive, this new vintage of Cristal Rosé is dry and perfumed, packed with fruit and tightened by acidity.

1094;"Portugal,1,1120,""Tinta Negra Mole, widely planted in Madeira, is a chameleon grape that can take on the character of any grape or style the producer fancies.

Drink now.""";
1095;"Italy,21,29400,""You can tell a Dal Forno wine a mile away thanks to the overall intensity and concentration of his well-crafted blends.

1096;"Italy,11,18700,""The 2004 Solaia is dense and concentrated with loads of character and defining aromatics: plump blackberry, chocolate fudge, exotic spice, peppercorn and smooth balsam notes. The real pleasure comes in the mouth where it delivers smooth elegance and an extra long finish.""";
1097;"Germany,3,240,""While sunny and ripe with scents of tropical fruit, orange and peach, this bang-for-your-buck Riesling reveals surprising complexities. It's sweet and lusciously fruity on the palate, but nuanced with rambling layers of dried herbs, earth and mineral tones. Finishes long with a lingering tea-leaf astringency.""";
1098;"England,1,770,""Very tender notes of baked apple and faint hints of creamy autolysis rise from the glass. The palate is tart and brisk, reminiscent of white currant and pale lemon. Slenderness is enlivened by the dosage which lends overtones of elderflower. Fine bubbles add welcome creaminess and leave you thoroughly refreshed.""";
1099;"US,1,1110,""While soft and approachable, this wine also offers a density of black currant and cherry that gives significant power and juicy exuberance. Sizable tannins risk overtaking the fruit, but never do, with the oak imparting a jolt of smokiness on the finish.""";
1100;"Australia,3,2580,""This is dark, almost black in color at the center, with greening evident at the rim. Syrupy, intense aromas of coffee and dark chocolate make an immediate impact on the nose, followed by syrupy, intense flavors of coffee and molasses. There's mind-boggling concentration here, but just enough acidity to provide a sense of balance. Still, it's hard to imagine drinking more than a couple of ounces of this at a time.""";
1101;"France,183,118950,""Wonderful notions of ivy leaves, citrus peel and conifer greet the nose. The aromatic impression leads onto a slender, dry and fluid palate that still seems tightly coiled and closed.

1102;"Chile,24,6720,""This wine starts out as dense and fruity, but turns floral with airing. In the mouth, it's a bit jammy and overextracted, making for a weighty drinking experience. Flavors of prune, blackberry and dark chocolate end quickly on a finish that lacks the structure to go the distance.""";
1103;"Germany,2,1660,""Notes of hay, pollen and beeswax add a savory, honeyed tone to this exquisitely dainty Riesling. The palate is intensely packed with sweet citrus fruit, but it's balanced with striking acidity and a shower of minerality on the finish.""";
1104;"Germany,2,6320,""Exhilarating tropical perfume leaps from the glass of this intensely aromatic Trockenbeerenauslese.

1105;"South Africa,6,4800,""There's a lot of earthy spice character to this wine, as assertive aromas of purple florals, whole cinnamon stick, nutmeg and clove are supported by a frame of small forest berries. Medium weight and round on the palate with a mulled boysenberry-flavored finish.""";

1108;"Spain,1,710,""Questionable value at $70, but this is very good and rather unique white Rioja. Remelluri uses a multitude of common and unheard-of grapes, and they hit it with a lot of oak.

Big at 14.5%, but it will go really well with baked fish or lobster.""";
1109;"Australia,1,1220,""Mouthfilling and supple, this is a top-notch example of Barossa Shiraz. Despite the soft tannins, the fruit is bright and lively, with tart red plum and raspberry notes at the core, surrounded by hints of vanilla and mint.

1110;"Germany,28,9240,""While the nose is demure, suggesting only a hint of muted apple and pear, the sweet-tart palate on this spry wine is full of yellow-cherry flavor. Bracing acidity wraps the finish up tight and brisk.""";
1111;"Chile,18,5220,""Warm, loamy, baked berry and cherry scents are the lead aromas on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Syrah that also brings a green character into play.

1112;"Chile,6,2160,""Some of the best-bred Carmenères in the world are grown in Peumo, and a star example is this saturated, minty wine with medium-weight tannins and a long finish. It's lush, powerful and along the way you taste pepper, chocolate, berries and sunshine.""";
1113;"Australia,119,20230,""Young Hunter Valley Sémillon is one of the most perplexing wines to evaluate, and I suspect that in 8–10 years' time, my rating will seem overly stingy.

1116;"Bulgaria,1,260,""A blend of 60% Mavrud and 40% Rubin, this ruby-colored wine has aromas of black berry, black plum and a touch of powdered cocoa. In the mouth, flavors recall black cherry, black raspberry and a hint of mocha and espresso. Tannins are soft and the finish is persistent.""";
1117;"Spain,4,2640,""Smoky, dark aromas of minty blackberry, tobacco, black coffee and toast are complex and lead to a tight bullish palate with fierce tannins. Dark, toasty flavors of black fruits and dark chocolate finish grabby but with freshness and a sense of purity. Drink 2018–2034.""";

1120;"Austria,5,3450,""The heady scent of baked apple and candied orange peel merges into a citrus-zesty, supersweet but tight palate. Sugar-crusted citrus peel—orange, mandarin and tangerine—play about the palate alongside a notion of fragrant pine resin. A rarity and source of pure joy. If you have a fruitcake laced with candied peel, don't hold back.""";
1121;"Argentina,5,3200,""Year by year, Salentein's top wines are improving. Primum is truly a fine wine, right up there with the country's best.

1122;"France,1,6600,""Big tannins and impressive fruits are the hallmarks of this impressive wine. It is also subtle, not showing all its flavors at once, hiding beneath tannins and structure. For this fruity vintage, it shows a strong sense of direct, solid structure, only allowing the strong black plum and berry flavors to come through slowly. It is for the long haul, so don't drink before 2022, even better later.""";
1123;"Spain,2,1640,""Lots of oak gives the nose a strong coconut essence, while the flavors of baked red plum and berries bring along notes of pepper and spice.

1126;"Germany,14,8400,""With a veritable bouquet of honeysuckle, fresh herb and freesia, this is one fragrant Riesling. Crisp and clean on the palate, it's sweet-tasting and easy-drinking, with ultraripe stone fruit and a prickle of lime-skin astringency on the finish.""";
1127;"France,3,3540,""This wine has a smoky character that gives an exotic touch to the red fruits. It comes from 60-year old vines that give concentration and dark tannins. As it ages, the wine will broaden and expand to convey opulence and richness. Drink from 2022.""";

1131;"France,1,2730,""A rich, mouthfilling,  sophisticated wine. The secret is in the balance, with the concentrated fruit flavors—dried apricot, mango and lemon—in just the right proportion. It tastes delicious now, but will certainly age over five years or more.""";

It's fat, oily and rich right now, and a bit warming on the finish.""";
1134;"Argentina,11,660,""With solid peach aromas and an otherwise clean nose, this llama is worth the ride. Peach and honeydew flavors are sweet but not cloying or mucky, and there's even a hint of spicy white pepper to give the finish character.""";
1135;"US,896,170240,""Young and spicy, this easy-drinking Pinot Gris still shows some bite and some bitterness, perhaps from skin contact. Give it a little more bottle age, and drink it chilled, to bring out the tart fruit and cut the phenolics.""";

1191;"Italy,541,270500,""You'll find earthy aromas of used leather, game and a slight whiff of barnyard on this soulful red. The funky aromas follow over to the palate along with fleshy black cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and a note of salted game. The rounded tannins are rather forward for such a young Barolo. Drink 2019–2025.""";
1192;"France,1,6980,""With 83% Sémillon in the blend, this wine has weight as well as richness. At the same time, it has a crisp edge, a smoky character from wood aging and the fine balance between citrus and more exotic fruits. It is a wine to age for many years. Drink from 2022.""";
1193;"Argentina,2,2600,""Get prepared for another star wine from this Patagonian winery. Fresh berry, graphite, cola and toasty aromas lead to a big and smooth palate with supercharged black fruit, herb, toast and mocha flavors. It's spicy, dry, balanced and not the least bit out of shape. No matter how you cut it, this is an excellent Argentine Malbec to drink now through 2020.""";
1194;"Argentina,8,2880,""With a bright violet color and jammy boysenberry and black-cherry aromas, this amounts to a fruity, chunky blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. On the palate, blackberry flavors run inky and come with a lot of oak and vanilla. A round, creamy finish is chewy and lush. Drink through 2019.""";
1195;"Croatia,6,1500,""This wine is rich garnet colored, with flavors of pomegranate, dark plum and cranberry that excite the palate. Fruit forward, well-structured and thoroughly enjoyable.""";
1196;"Chile,3,2580,""Saturated and black as night, with floral aromas mixed with earth, juniper and pruney fruit. Meaty and dark flavors ride on a bed of leathery, grabby tannins. Spicy, meaty and a touch herbal on the grinding, tannic finish.""";

1198;"US,2,1660,""The excellent Maresh vineyard is the source of these grapes. Lovely aromas of leaf and cherry open into a wine generous with pretty flavors of black raspberry and cherry.

1200;"Spain,1,1660,""Huge wine with sweetness and smooth qualities from head to toe. Aromas of mint leaf, pastry and sweet black fruits are magnetic, while the lush, layered palate is complete and packed with berry fruit, toast, fudge and tobacco flavors. Layered and deep on the finish, with cola, herbs and licorice notes. Beautiful wine. Drinkable now and good through 2013.""";
1201;"Mexico,1,170,""This pink wine is made from Grenache grapes. It's fresh, clean and spunky on the nose, with good acidity cutting into what would otherwise be a thick body. Flavors of plum, cherry and citrus make this a solid rosado from Mexico.""";
1202;"Austria,10,4700,""There is something that makes me think about a summer forest: Is it the fresh moss, the fresh green foliage, the implied ease and freshness of light green foliage on a warm day? The palate stuns with white pepper and purity and combines fruit ripeness with ballerina-like poise. Wonderful texture. Prepare to be moved.""";
1203;"Germany,19,7030,""Whiffs of vanilla, saffron, peach and yellow cherry lend exotic flair to this unctuous yet delicate dessert wine. A blend of Riesling, Scheurebe and Huxelrebe grapes, its unique composition lends plumpness of fruit balanced by zesty acidity and a lingering waxy sheen. It's sure to be a dramatic finish to an elegant dinner event, yet surprisingly affordable.""";
1204;"Canada,5,4000,""Inniskillin continues to push the boundaries of icewine, as evidenced by this wood-aged Vidal. The vanilla and spice of oak barrels partially masks some of the stranger Vidal aromas, allowing the apricot and peach scents to come to the fore. There are some creamy lactic notes on the finish that detract slightly, but this is a very good effort at an entirely different genre.""";
1205;"France,2,3360,""This wine has power and firm tannins. Intensely fresh, it offers acidity and red-currant flavors that burst out of the dark, dry core. It's complex, with a touch of spice from wood aging that gives an elegant, delicious aftertaste. Drink from 2019.""";
1206;"Australia,4,200,""Tropical—the flavors are reminiscent of mango and guava—but lacking in intensity. It's cleanly made, showing just a hint of warmth on the finish.""";
1207;"Austria,1,1600,""On the nose, a blast of beeswax and honey provides heady lift. The palate is tooth-breakingly sweet but comes with that honeyed, candied-citrus thrill. Sufficient bright acidity counters all the richness. The mouthfeel is full, oily and viscous, always with that honeycomb and beeswax note, not quite tipping into the savoriness of maple syrup. Despite all the decadent sweetness, the finish is still lip-smacking, clean and endless.""";
1208;"Portugal,1,1750,""Any vintage Colheita is ready to drink once it is bottled, but this wine is readier than most. It's at a perfect stage of development, on the dry side although with some fine dried apricot and raisin flavors. It is poised and elegant, a beautiful wine to drink now.""";
1209;"Australia,2,5000,""With a mere 422 bottles produced, this review is barely more than academic, as it will be near impossible to track down some of this. Lucky/persistent lotto winners will experience a medium- to full-bodied red with a velvety mouthfeel, cassis, vanilla and cedar notes and something akin to charred tomato.""";
1210;"Chile,20,9000,""This is dense, lusty and attractive from the beginning, with rich black-fruit, coconut, tobacco and pine aromas.

1211;"Italy,1,2920,""Aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, fig, resin, leather and exotic spice lead the nose on this just-released ten-year-old.

It has already hit the start of its ideal drinking window so enjoy sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.""";
1212;"Spain,4,2560,""Very nice for a 2002. The wine is elegant and delivers aromas of violets, minerals and dried fruits. The palate folds in chocolate and spice along with a layer of blackberry flavor. We wouldn't call it superconcentrated or complex, but it's driven, pure and pleasurable. Smells, weighs and tastes a lot like Bordeaux.""";

1214;"Portugal,1,2680,""The sweetness of the wine vies with the acidity to bring out a dense structure, black currant flavors and firm tannins that are strongly integrated into the ripe texture. This is a gorgeous, dense, concentrated wine, coming into balance while showing great structure and potential.""";
1215;"France,5,7750,""With Arbane and Pinot Blanc, two of the rarely used Champagne grapes in the blend, this is a fascinating small-production wine. Grown in the village of Celles in the Aube region, it is ripe with rich yellow and spicy fruit as well as good acidity. It is just mature and can be drunk now.""";
1216;"Canada,5,3500,""While Equifera, produced by Inniskillin co-founder, Donald Ziraldo, may still be an unfamiliar name, one sip of this Riesling ice wine is proof of its impeccable pedigree.

1218;"France,2,7300,""This wine is structured with impressively ripe fruit. Black-plum juice and blackberries are balanced with a strong tannic content that gives the wine backbone and structure. It has weight, although with its already exuberant fruitiness, it is not likely to be really long-term wine. Drink from 2024. From 120 acres, only the best grapes go into this top wine and 2013 was a smaller crop than the average (10,000 to 12,000 cases). Believed to be the oldest of the five Bordeaux first growths, Haut-Brion has been in the Clarence Dillon family since 1935. The current president is Prince Robert de Luxembourg.""";
1219;"Austria,18,8640,""Yeasty roundness meets opulently ripe fruit: red-cheeked apple, yellow pear and juicy yellow peach. The spicy verve of grapefruit zest pulls it into focus. This interplay on fruit and freshness dominates the midpalate majestically and has a staying citrus-power.""";
1220;"New Zealand,1,680,""This is a sexy wine from one of New Zealand's biodynamic stars. The aroma is a heady blend of cinnamon and earth notes, alongside game, chocolate, ripe red fruits, warm stones, and forrest floor.

1221;"Germany,3,2820,""Sunny and fragrant, this intensely concentrated auslese brims with flavors of lusciously ripe yellow peach and tangerine. It's lush in mouthfeel but delicately textured, the finish fading slowly into a kiss of honey and saffron. Delicious now but should continue to improve for decades to come.""";
1222;"US,1,2350,""An ultrarich Cabernet whose ripe fruit is as elaborate as you can get. Ditto for the soft, plush tannins and the wealth of fine, sweet oak. Despite the wealth of blackberry, currant, dark chocolate and cola flavors, it's not a wine to drink now, because the tannins and acids are so pert. Give it a good six years in the cellar.""";
1223;"Spain,1,970,""Mature, ripe aromas of raisin, caramel, tobacco and fine oak form a pleasing, inviting bouquet. Drawing, edgy and still quite tannic in feel, this tastes rooty, baked and lightly stewed, with just enough berry and plum fruit to prop things up. On the finish, chocolate, prune and baked notes of pastry and cake are potent and delicious. Drink through 2027.""";
1224;"France,1,1330,""This wine is dark and dense, very closed at this young stage. But wait for that rich fruit to burst out to give its intense acidity and ripeness to the wine. It's a powerhouse of flavors, spice and dark minerality. Drink from 2022.""";
1225;"Germany,3,7500,""While sometimes the Pauly-Bergweiler wines come across as too simply sweet, this one hits all the right notes, from an outrageously exotic bouquet of dried apricots, orange marmalade and faintly sweaty socks that add a kinky edge to the rich, layered texture in the mouth and virtually endless finish. Should age effortlessly for decades, but it's pretty spectacular now.""";
1226;"Chile,77,30800,""Year after year this Syrah-led blend excels. This version is bright, clean and polished. Cherry and plum aromas are racy, with distinct minerality.

1227;"Italy,1,1160,""Castello Romitorio has been showing impressive results the last five years or so. This Riserva opens with opulent, dark concentration and bright aromas of dark cherry, leather, tobacco and spice. There's a dusty mineral shading at the back and with a long-lasting finish.""";
1228;"Chile,2,1520,""This is a stately Cabernet housing classic Chilean aromas of spicy, berry fruits mixed with earth notes. It's supremely fresh on the palate, with layers of briar fruit and integrated oak. Baked berry, hard spice and exotic chocolate flavors end toasty and warm, but lively and complex. Drink through 2024.""";
1229;"France,1,3190,""A beautiful wine, smooth, polished, with rounded corners. Its intense fruit is balanced and harmonizes well with the sweet tannins, the layers of wood and the red berry flavors. Certainly powerful, it impresses equally with the pleasure it will give in 7–10 years.""";
1230;"Argentina,1,1080,""After opening with graham cracker, plum and ripe berry, the wine settles into a thick and heavy place that's rich but bordering on cloying. This is a heavy style of Malbec that tastes of ripe black fruits and herbs. It's toasty, full, thick as can be and long on the finish. Drinkable now but could use a couple of more years for everything to mesh.""";
1231;"Germany,3,2160,""While there's plenty of peachy, primary perfume, crushed slate and stone form the backbone of this deeply mineral Riesling.

1234;"Chile,15,4050,""While the nose on this sweetie isn't deep, it's lush, inviting and peachy as they come. The palate feels fresh and straightforward, and the flavor profile blends tropical fruit flavors with spice and honey accents. Overall this seems natural, easygoing and expressive.""";
1235;"France,2,7800,""This Champagne is produced for the Bordeaux Rothschild families to serve at events in their chateaus (Mouton, Lafite, Clarke). It is a beautiful wine that manages to be both rich and tightly textured with minerality, crisp apple flavor and a hint of toast balances all elements so well. A limited amount is available outside the family circuit. Drink now.""";
1236;"US,1,7500,""This is a powerful bottling, as is expected by this producer, showing fresh boysenberry, purple flower potpourri, tart black plums and a touch of rosemary on the nose. It's undeniably delicious at first sip, with caramelized blackberry and hints of thyme and rosemary. The texture is squeaky and sticky, and it's a bit sweet and boozy, but a definite Paso crowd-pleaser.""";
1237;"US,13,6630,""Though it's a niche variety in the state, Carmenère has always been a flagship wine for this winery. This one is all varietal, with aromas of herbs, freshly cut green and jalapeño peppers. It coats the palate with dark fruit and savory flavors.""";

1240;"Italy,154,41580,""You'll love the elegant packaging, seals and silk ribbons that adorn this festive red blend from Piedmont. Aromas of ripe fruit, spice, leather and dark chocolate are followed by tight, sweet tannins and a lean mouthfeel.""";

1242;"US,14,13860,""Unless you knew that this was Dominus and had tasted older vintages, you might not be impressed. In its youth the wine is tannic and dry and linear. However, it is Dominus and it does need cellaring. Right now it shows blackberry, black currant, cedar and baker's chocolate flavors. Will slowly open and reach maturity after 2011, and could easily develop for far longer.""";
1243;"New Zealand,3,2400,""Starts off with a bold blast of Maraschino cherry fruit, backstopped by hints of oaky spice and vanilla. It's medium in body, structured around silky tannins that frame flavors of cherries, button mushrooms and just enough cedary oak. Drink now–2015.""";

The acidity is perfectly balanced so you can appreciate its velvety richness without feeling that the sweetness is too cloying.""";
1247;"Austria,1,1290,""Aromatic and spicy fruit speaks here: ripe blueberry and black cherry with brooding insinuations of flower and earth.

1248;"Germany,21,19320,""Whiffs of pine frond and moss lend a cool, alpine air to the nose of this medium-dry Riesling, but the palate is all lemon drops and sunshine. Juicy citrus flavor is uplifted by a stream of acidity that's invigoratingly fresh.""";

Age this wine for five years and more.""";

Within the vibrant range of sensual flavor is salted caramel, black cherry and chocolate, alongside a twist of saddle and campfire coffee. Its grip of focused tannin suggests years of aging potential";
1286;"Hungary,2,1600,""This ethereal Tokaji Aszú is golden in color, with aromas of delicate acacia flower, honeysuckle, fresh peach and tinned apricot. The flavors come alive on the palate, showing luscious apricot, floral honeycomb and fresh pear juice. The acidity is perfectly balanced to prevent this delightful wine from being too cloying.""";
1287;"Bulgaria,29,2610,""Well priced and friendly, this Muskat has the honeyed, floral character of a traditional muscat, but also a lemony wave that overrides the rest. The citrus mutes the prettier character here, but overall, it's a good, exotic sip at a great price.""";
1288;"Mexico,2,1120,""This Cabernet blend is one of Baja's best reds. Cured meat, dry spice and brandied berry aromas lead to an elegant (by Baja standards) palate with herbal hints, plenty of spice, solid cherry and berry flavors, and modest tannins. This wine has guts and delivers the goods";
1289;"France,1,6170,""This new release from a great vintage for Chardonnay in Champagne is a perfect blanc de blancs, showing a wealth of intensity from the crisp, chalky, mineral tones to the perfumed apple notes. The aromas hint at developing toastiness that adds depth and complexity. The wine is still young and it will age for years. Drink from 2020.""";
1290;"Australia,18,18000,""With only 10 cases imported to the U.S., one suspects that this terrific wine will largely be found in exclusive restaurants. If you can find a bottle at a reasonable markup, jump on it, for this is one of Victoria's finest Shirazes. Hickory smoke, espresso and herbal notes accent raspberry fruit, whose brightness gives the wine extra lift and dimension. It's creamy and lushly textured without ever seeming heavy, and boasts a long, silky finish that echoes with suggestions of cocoa powder and pulverized coffee beans. Drink now–2025.""";
1291;"New Zealand,3,2100,""Possibly just in a sullen phase, this reserve bottling from Craggy's home vineyard is dominated for the moment by smoke and cedar on the nose, and while there is some cherry fruit apparent in the mouth, it doesn't appear to be fully expressing itself. The impression is of a wine that's tightly coiled and may yet improve with another year or two of aging.""";
1292;"Chile,1,870,""A dense bouquet of dark cherries, plum, earth, meat and subtle tobacco pulls you in. It is big in the mouth, yet never brutish, with lovely depth of fruit flavor, earthy accents and great texture. The fine, long finish has even, dry tannins. Seductively accessible, this world class wine will age well for 6–12 years or longer.""";
1293;"Australia,25,5750,""This wine almost quivers with freshness when first sniffed, it's so vibrant and citrusy. Then it broadens out nicely on the palate, delivering ripe melon and apple flavors and ample weight. Drink it now and over the next few months.""";
1294;"Italy,85,31450,""You'll find blue flower, exotic spice, truffle and camphor aromas in this firm, medium-bodied red. The linear palate shows sour cherry, cranberry, licorice and espresso notes held tight with fine-grained tannins.""";
1295;"US,18,16020,""This is Doubleback's first vintage to include estate-grown grapes in the blend. Truffle, mocha and ripe purple-fruit scents explode from the glass. Ample acidity underscores the chewy tannins. A dense and ageworthy wine, this needs more bottle-age to show its best";
1296;"Italy,2,2920,""Multifaceted aromas of rose, iris, leather, cranberry, truffle and the barest hint of game lead the nose. The radiant palate offers creamy strawberry, ripe red cherry, orange zest, baking spice, dried herb and tobacco alongside firm but polished tannins. Fresh acidity provides balance while a mineral vein energizes the finish. With its smooth texture, it's already tempting but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018–2026.""";
1297;"US,37,53650,""Velvety and plush on the palate, this classic Cabernet offers firm, youthful tannins and full-bodied concentration of dense black fruit. Cedar, dried herb and tobacco scents frame its core, broadcasting a burning intensity and sanguine chewiness. Cellar and enjoy best 2023–2033.""";
1298;"France,4,4440,""Wood aging does not help the richness of this wine. It brings out toast and covers the glorious sweet fruits. With acidity thrown in the balance is not there. Maybe several years will help, so don't drink before 2017.""";
1299;"Greece,6,1440,""This unfolding white offers lemon and oaky spice on the nose and palate, with rounded, silky flavors and a spicy finish. A bit bigger and richer, it can handle bigger dishes—think lobster, oysters, cream dishes.""";
1300;"France,3,4260,""While the color of this wine is light, the intensity and the structure are not. It comes from 30-year-old vines, planted densely that gives the wine huge concentration. It is firm full of tannins that lie over the ripe fruit. As it develops, this wine will be sumptuous, ripe and impressive. Wait until 2023.""";
1301;"Slovenia,5,900,""This blend of 40% Furmint, 40% Pinot Gris and 20% Riesling has aromas of pineapple, lychee fruit and fresh herbs. It's thin and racy in the mouth with flavors of mango, apple and guava.""";
1302;"Spain,1,2040,""Talk about magnetic aromas of bacon, tobacco and bold black fruit, and then comes an oak-rich palate full of coconut, butter, chocolate and exotic berry flavor. Chocolate truffle and pastry work the finish, and overall this is a mile-deep beauty to drink from 2011 through 2017.""";
1303;"Austria,39,15210,""While the wine is technically dry, its richness gives it a sweeter sensation. The ripe apricot and pineapple fruit is cut with knife-like acidity, allowing this concentrated wine to remain poised, with a crisp finish.""";
1304;"France,367,88080,""Wood aged and serious, this is a finely balanced wine. Its spice and toast notes are beginning to come together with its young, exuberant fruit and acidity. Black currant flavors dominate, giving it a crisp, juicy edge. Drink this impressive wine from 2021.""";
1305;"France,217,119350,""Yeasty in style with a touch of bitterness, this Champagne's raspberry fruitiness is just a minor part of the equation. It shows tight, edgy character up front and a light toasty quality on the finish.""";
1306;"Italy,584,93440,""Young, juicy and enjoyable, this round fruity red opens with aromas of wild berry, violet and a whiff of white pepper. With 80% Nebbiolo and the remainder being Vespolina, Croatina and Uva Rara, the savory easy-drinking palate doles out mouthfuls of ripe black cherry and crushed raspberry accented with hints of clove. Supple tannins give it a smooth texture. Enjoy soon.""";
1307;"Hungary,14,3500,""This wine is made from 100% Furmint and has an intriguing bouquet of jasmine and lemon blossom. It is crisp and acidic on the palate with pleasant flavors of lemon zest and lime juice.""";
1308;"Chile,6,7200,""With spicy aromas of kirsch and dark plum accented by cedar and tobacco, this blend of Carmenère, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot is a whopper. In the mouth, it's thick and syrupy, with chewy tannins and bold flavors of baked berry and chocolate. On the finish, brown sugar and coconut enter the frame. This is ultraripe and aggressive, but it honestly exemplifies Chile at the high end. Drink now–2017";
1309;"Australia,35,3850,""With the number of really good dessert wines available for under $12 per bottle severely limited, this is a refreshing ray of golden sweetness. Dried apricots add enough citrus pith to partially balance out the intensely sweet flavors. Drink in the lusciousness over the next couple of years.""";
1310;"France,16,13120,""With spice and wood right up front, this wine is toasty and rich. It has a creamy texture along with bright acidity and a generous body. The wine, with its smooth, ripe aftertaste, is of course young. Drink from 2017.""";
1311;"France,3,8580,""This grand cru bottling comes from vines owned by Louis Jadot. It's firmly structured, as befits a wine from this village, and shows a predominance of red fruit and acidity. However, with its dry core and concentration, it will need to age. Drink from 2025.""";
1312;"Uruguay,3,1290,""Ripe earthy aromas of raisin and oaky vanilla open this heavy, saturated Tannat that displays jagged tartaric acidity and heat (15.5% ABV). Stewed berry, raisin and vanilla flavors finish full, tannic and chunky. All in all, this seems a bit overdone and overripe.""";
1313;"Germany,9,3240,""Zesty and lean, this exquisitely fine-framed Riesling builds in intensity. It's mineral and spry from start to finish, but juicy-sweet tangerine and honey notes add brightness and sunshine to the midpalate. It's enjoyable now, but likely to intensify through 2025.""";
1314;"Spain,30,12600,""True as dry oloroso comes, with nutty aromas combined with caramel richness. Feels raring to go, with pumped-up acidity that boosts otherwise normal flavors of dried white fruits, mixed nuts and brine. Tight, long and driving on the finish.""";
1315;"Italy,19,1330,""You can't beat this price for a Pinot Grigio with natural freshness and pristine aromas of stone fruit and citrus. The nice thing is that it tastes Italian made, and not like many of the commercial, generic Grigios on the market today.""";
1316;"US,43,45150,""Young and precise, this balances flavors of wild raspberries against a mineral foundation. Suggestions of wet stone and a dash of brown spices come through, with lots of supporting acidity. As it fades, there's a lick of chocolate from aging in 29% new French oak.""";
1317;"France,1,4100,""A marvelously intense wine, the Chardonnay singing with light toast and acidity. The wine has layers of green apple, spice, a tight texture and orange zest highlights. Age for at least seven years.""";
1318;"Chile,1,1490,""Intense and compact on the nose, this has cola, mint, cassis and blackberry aromas that are tightly knit. The palate is narrow and intense, with lightly herbal, reedy flavors of saucy, savory berry and herb. This is a leading Carmenère, but it's not as flavorful and substantive as prior years.""";
1319;"Chile,18,13500,""This six-grape blend opens with aromas of charred oak, shoe polish, lemon rind, plum and currant. It's tight, tannic and clampy in feel, with charred berry, spicy herb and citric notes. Bell pepper, spaghetti sauce and rawness define the finish on this snappy, coarse blend. Drink through 2017.""";
1320;"France,9,9360,""This is one of the most delicious rosé Champagnes around, a gorgeous vibrant red currant- and pink grapefruit-dominated wine. It's ripe, but so well balanced, its acidity merging into a fine creaminess. It is a wine that is lively, vivid, but remaining dry.""";
1321;"Canada,1,540,""The aromatics are interesting but a bit deceptive, showing a rather salty, herbal scent suggesting green olives. Once tasted, the unctuous apricot and candied pineapple fruit takes over, with lime and quince as well. It's ready right now for immediate consumption.""";
1322;"Greece,29,7250,""With its sea salt, lemon peel and fresh-fruit aromas, this wine offers focus and finesse from the beginning. On the palate, bright lemon and lime peel flavors and a pronounced mineral edge are beautifully integrated. This is a terroir-driven white that's made for fresh fish and vegetarian dishes.""";
1323;"Spain,13,7670,""Tree bark, rubber and berry aromas get this blend going. The palate shows piquant, zesty acidity, which pumps up dry, herbal, tangy flavors of red-berry fruits. On the finish, it's all about rubber, pepper, herbs and tomato, all wrapped in zesty acidity.""";
1324;"Slovenia,1,370,""Intense aromas of freshly picked mint and dried herb drive the bouquet. On the palate there are flavors of black currant, black plum and tobacco leaf. The finish is long with a pleasant level of acidity.""";
1325;"Australia,48,24000,""You've got to like oak to appreciate this wine, which is presently dominated by scents of vanilla, mocha and toasted coconut. It's full bodied and velvety in texture, with hints of black cherry lurking in the background.""";
1326;"Romania,1,40,""Notes of sun-dried hay and green flower highlight the nose and palate of this fresh, easy-quaffing wine. Concentrated tangerine and pineapple flavors are brisk and tasty.""";
1327;"Germany,2,1580,""Saffron and dusty mineral tones seep into notes of marmalade and candied orange peel in this intensely ripe honeyed Riesling. The palate bursts with yellow peach and mango, but savory tinges of earth and petrol peek through enticingly. It's dazzling now, a veritable explosion of sweetness, acidity and minerality, but should meld beautifully from 2020-2025.""";
1328;"Chile,123,9840,""Zippy, with natural rubbery aromas. This is quite tart and has a personality defined by lemon. There's lemon torte up front, while at the end it's purely tangy and sharp. Not an astringent, scouring wine, but high acidity comes into play.""";
1329;"New Zealand,66,16500,""Yealands is based in the Awatere Valley, a subregion of Marlborough that offers generally cooler, later ripening than the main (Wairau) valley. This is a fresh, sappy, medium-bodied Pinot Noir, featuring notes of cherry, vanilla and herb. It should provide easy quaffing over the next few years.""";
1330;"Germany,6,6660,""This delicate cool-climate Pinot Noir is fresh and dainty, with a red cherry flavor and plumes of rose petal and green flower perfume. Sour plum acidity and fine-grained but penetrating tannins add brace and backbone.""";
1331;"Slovenia,3,900,""Intensely green and herbal on the nose, this has penetrating flavors of gooseberry, lavender, mint and grass. This Sauvignon Blanc, which was aged for two years in French barrique, is textural, with its hints of green-tea-like tannin.""";
1332;"France,3,4290,""This rich and full-bodied wine brings out the structure of a Chassagne premier cru. It has generous fruits and a toasty structure. Drink from 2017.""";
1333;"South Africa,66,7260,""This wine starts with a curvy nose of pineapple, apricot and melon, leading into a very pretty interplay of tropical melon and spice on the palate. Elegant with a cheerful overall character, this Chenin balances acid and fruit well, creating a rounded wine with a delicate edge. Overall, dependable and fun.""";
1334;"US,2,2320,""This is a big, rich, flashy Cab. It's very ripe, brimming with jammy blackberry, currant, chocolate-covered raisin and spicy olive flavors. Drinks soft and opulent in instant appeal, but doesn't seem like a longterm ager. Best now through 2010.""";
1335;"Uruguay,5,2000,""Oak, vanilla and furry berry aromas are raisiny and overly sweet. This Ripasso from dried Tannat grapes weighs in heavy and feels rustic. Saturated toasty flavors of oak, prune and raisin finish dark, minty and chocolaty.""";
1336;"Australia,2,1440,""This dark-fruited, full-bodied Shiraz isn't for the faint of heart. Espresso, dark chocolate, roast meat and plum notes come together in a creamy-textured wine that finishes with a tart, hard edge of acidity and a dusting of cocoa powder-like tannins.""";
1337;"France,9,7740,""With its wonderful poise between dark structure and intensely fragrant fruit, this is firm, dry and packed with ripe blackberry fruits. It has great potential, as befits a concentrated wine from Vosne-Romanée, and is certainly not ready to drink before 2020.""";
1338;"France,1,2020,""Richly endowed, the wine is beautifully concentrated. Still young it has considerable potential with its rich fruits and firm tannins. There is a strongly juicy aftertaste that brings in the freshness of the year. The wine will age well, and should not be drunk before 2026.""";
1339;"Germany,1,860,""There's a thrilling, ethereal lightness to this feather-weight eiswein. Its luscious melon and mango flavors are dizzying with sweetness, but a laser shock of acidity anchors the midpalate neatly. The finish is slick, lingering on a waxy, caramel tone. Gorgeous now, it should continue to drink well for decades.""";
1340;"Israel,4,360,""Opens with solid grape and red-currant fruit accented by tobacco, but on the palate the wine is light for a Petite Sirah, usually a hefty wine. As the fruit is from very young vines, it's not a terrible surprise, and it's a positive sign that Israeli winemakers are stretching their horizons. Finishes tart-sweet, with red berry fruit and a hint of licorice.""";
1341;"Slovenia,2,480,""This salmon-colored rosé suggests aromas of powdered sugar, red raspberry and dried herbs. It is soft on the entry with a touch of sweetness and flavors of Red Delicious apple, Turkish delight and marzipan.""";
1342;"Canada,22,6600,""Well along the aging curve, this feels a bit pushed, with divergent and strong flavors of cherry, plum, licorice, smoke and sweet toast. There's a lot going on, though little sense of the elegance that often typifies Pinot Noir, and the tannins have a rough, rustic quality.""";
1343;"South Africa,2,5500,""What a bold and powerful selection this is. It opens with intense aromas of blackberry, black plum and boysenberry that are hit with spicy notes of black pepper, cured meat, leather and Thin Mint. The plush and concentrated palate is like crushed velvet in texture, with gripping yet balanced tannins to support the rich, dense black-fruit flavors. The finish transitions from black cherry and boysenberry fruit to menthol, followed by lingering cocoa nib and charred oak tones. Drink 2019–2024.""";
1344;"Germany,1,6120,""Hugely sweet yet reasonably balanced given its enormous concentration, this is a tremendous example of the quality heights sweet Riesling can achieve. Golden raisin, dried apricots and candied pineapple all swirl together in a delicious haze of sugar-coma-inducing syrup that nevertheless goes down easily. Will age easily for decades.""";
1345;"Germany,16,11200,""Zesty lemon and lime skins perfume this dry, steely Riesling. It's bold in body yet edged with razor-sharp acidity. The midpalate yields slowly with touches of quince and tangerine that linger nicely through the finish.""";
1346;"France,27,21060,""While the wine is very sweet, the sweetness does not stand out as much as the intense spiciness. It's a gorgeous wine without excess, textured and with minerality. The aftertaste has a light touch of acidity. It's impressive now, although it will be better from 2018.""";
1347;"South Africa,1,3300,""Only 95 cases were made of this Bordeaux-style blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Malbec and 24% Cabernet Franc. It's a stellar example of the high-end and highly cellarable wines that can come out of South Africa, oozing with depth, concentration and complexity, all in a harmonious, balanced package. It's dark and brooding right off the bat, boasting firm, tight blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit that's coupled with hints of raspberry sauce, pressed violets and baking spice. The palate is strong and packed with black fruit flavors that lead into a long, evolving finish of char, espresso bean, cigar and woodspice. Firmly structured and robust in feel, try from 2022–2028, though it could mature well even beyond.""";
1348;"US,3,3360,""Sourced from the O'Shaughnessy Vineyard across from the producer's winery on Oakville Cross Road, this is a youthfully shy wine, firm in integrated and expansive tannin. Tobacco, clove, cedar and cherry interweave themselves flavorfully on the palate, with plenty of length shining through on the finish.""";
1349;"Italy,1,1090,""Barolo Ornato is a beautiful wine: rich in flavor, intensity and personality. You can taste the quality of the fruit here thanks to the pristine notes of cherry, wild berry, spice and ginger that emerge from the nose. Oak notes of vanilla and cinnamon are nicely integrated and folded within the wine's dense, supple texture.""";
1350;"Australia,17,4420,""While this wine comes out of the chute loaded with toast, mocha and brown sugar-inflected oak, the wood falls appropriately into the background on the palate, allowing cassis fruit to come forward. It's firm and tannic, with a powerful structure that requires a few years to come into perfect balance";
1351;"Australia,29,6960,""Vanilla and fresh lumber notes lead the way, but gardenia and stone fruits emerge in the mouth and lead to a long, creamy finish remniscent of a peach milkshake. A final kick of acidity keeps the whole thing balanced.""";
1352;"Australia,3,1230,""The Shaw and Smith M3 Chardonnay continues to be a reliable performer, with the 2007 showing more restrained oak influence than in the past. It's still smoky and toasty upfront, but backed by ample apple and citrus fruit, and on the palate there's more of a toasted-grain note rather than overt vanilla and spice. Acids are crisp, elegantly extending the finish.""";
1353;"Portugal,42,29400,""With its enticing perfumes, sweet plum and damson fruit flavors, this is initially a seductive wine. But at the same time, the vivid acidity and the strong tannic element suggest good aging potential.""";
1354;"Hungary,7,2100,""This straw-colored wine has floral aromas of jasmine and honeysuckle and crisp flavors of lemon zest and grapefruit juice. The finish is lively and lingers.""";
1355;"France,1,1890,""Still young, this is a wine that needs to open and ripen. But already there are signs of richness, a wood- and tropical fruit-flavored wine that is typical of the full character of a Corton Charlemagne. It would be worth keeping 2–3 years for the wood to soften, the fruit to round out.""";
1356;"US,1,1260,""There's good structure to this Cabernet, thanks to the firm tannins and ample acidity. But the flavors take the starring role, with raspberries, cherries, currants, mocha and cedar. It has a light, delicate mouthfeel, although there's nothing light about the taste. It's complex and ageable, so give it until 2020 to begin to come around.""";
1357;"Canada,6,1440,""This is just the second vintage for this winery, whose inviting labels look like handwritten notes. The rosé captures the bright color, fresh fruit and silky texture of its Pinot Noir grape";
1358;"France,5,8450,""This rounded, well-textured wine is dominated by Pinot Noir, with a distinctly mineral streak from the Chardonnay. Poised between richness and elegance, it is ready to drink. Krug numbers the successive blends of its Grande Cuvée because it regards each blending as unique.""";
1359;"Chile,5,2400,""This Syrah-Cab blend is an oaky specimen with no shortage of vanilla, cream and sawdust on the nose. In the mouth, it's quite rich, almost to the point of being syrupy. Flavors of blackberry, toast, vanilla and popcorn announce even more generous oak, while the finish is warm in feel, with baked fruit, mint and vanilla flavors. Drink now–2017.""";
1360;"Georgia,1,400,""Aged in buried clay vessels in accordance with ancient Georgian winemaking techniques, then transferred to new oak, there's a core of bright cherry fruit, coffee grinds and vanilla on the nose and palate of this unique Saperavi. It's a good wine, but charred wood, jagged tannins and hints of barnyard tend to obscure all the lovely fruit.""";
1361;"Germany,3,3000,""This is a standout amongst an increasing number of German Pinot Noir now available stateside. While youthful still with aromas of fresh black cherries and berries, it's layered with shades of bramble, herb and granite, suggesting a long evolution that's still ahead. Elegantly structured with cranberry acidity and fine, penetrating tannins, it's a balanced wine that's sexy and seductive.""";
1362;"France,1,2060,""This vineyard is widely regarded for its quality worthy of grand cru status, and this wine, from vines owned by Louis Jadot, is a fine example. It is both structured and richly fruity—dense with ripe red fruit flavors cut with acidity. A dry core of tannins will allow this impressive wine to age. Drink from 2024.""";
1363;"Turkey,3,480,""Medium-straw colored in the glass, this has a soft bouquet of guava and pineapple. It is slightly stiff at first, but tropical fruit flavors of guava and passion fruit with touches of lemon curd quickly wash across the palate. The citrus-laced finish offers long-lasting floral notes.""";
1364;"Italy,240,50400,""You'll find subdued aromas of leather, red currant and forest floor on this blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot. The simple palate delivers mature plum and toast offset by drying tannins. Drink soon.""";
1365;"Spain,2,3580,""Graphite, maple and other oaky aromas dominate this lush, pitch-black Tinto Fino. A chewy, dense mouthfeel is rich as an oil baron, while oak-driven flavors of vanilla and baking spices accent blackberry and cassis.

1367;"Australia,2,1140,""These 100-plus-year-old vines were transplanted to another site, but continue to yield outstanding wines. Intriguing aromas of fruit compote and roasted meat lead into a palate of blueberry and spice. It's medium to full in body, with supple tannins that finish on a faintly dusty note. Ready to drink now, but should hold at least through 2020.""";
1368;"France,460,87400,""Zestiness amid the rounded apricot and rose-petal flavors marks this out, while a pleasant, ever-so-slightly bitter phenolic edge gives just a little bite. The aromatics are subtly expressed and the real action happens on the textured palate.""";
1369;"Israel,5,700,""Refreshing from the first whiff of green apple, fuchsia, and almond blossom, it has flavors of peach, eucalyptus, green apple, and white flowers. Harmonious tannins persist to the bright note of the vanilla custard and orange zest finish, undercut by strong minerality.""";
1370;"Argentina,272,35360,""Zesty, tropical aromas are clean and approachable. This is a patio wine with juicy grapefruit and lime flavors. Lean notes of citrus grace a sharp, pointed finish.""";
1371;"New Zealand,17,7650,""Winemaker Matt Dicey has crafted a winner, seamlessly combining aromas and flavors of toast, cherry, smoke and dried herbs into a relatively full-bodied, muscular wine.

1372;"France,6,6420,""Very soft and creamy, with the open drinking style of many 2000 vintage wines. It has a good solid base of white fruits, apple skins and green almond, with the acidity light and fresh. Drink now.""";
1373;"Mexico,4,840,""Waxy smelling and gritty, with an oily overtone, this feels O.K. but sort of wayward, with flavors of bitter grapefruit and matchstick. Simple and somewhat sour on the finish.""";
1374;"Spain,243,60750,""Yeasty bready aromas are more smooth and leesy than fruity. This has a round palate that's full but not creamy due to firm acidity. Melon, peach and vanilla flavors finish yeasty and dry, with moderate complexity. This is made entirely from Pinot Noir.""";
1375;"Germany,1,3170,""Yes, this wine is supersweet, but it's also pristine in its clarity. Despite layers of honeyed richness, the aromas and flavors of lime and pineapple provide great energy and focus";
1376;"France,92,35880,""Wood-aging flavors have given this cru wine a toasty character that balances its natural fruitiness. The structure and linear character of the wine is prominent. The red fruits and acidity come through slowly at the end. Drink from mid-2017.""";
1377;"Georgia,1,220,""A blend of two grapes native to Georgia, this wine offers aromas of blueberry, clove and anisette. Its subtle sweetness provides a palate for flavors of blackberry, licorice, blueberry, cinnamon and nutmeg. Tannins seem soft from first sip to finish, yet a sense of chalkiness remains on the post palate, even outlasting closing notes of mint and tart cherry.""";
1378;"Austria,2,1420,""The lyra system of training vines is designed to give the fruit maximum exposure. With that and the vines' placement on the steep Heiligenstein hill, it's no surprise that this wine is ripe and rich. Perfumed, intense and generous, this will age for many years.""";
1379;"Italy,1,2370,""This sweet wine from Italy is guaranteed to blow your socks off. Its thickness and density resembles concentrated maple syrup or molasses. It is made with Prugnolo Gentile (Sangiovese) grapes that are air-dried and then aged in small wood containers for many careful years. The gorgeous aromas include roasted chestnuts, brown sugar, prunes and sweet figs and you can sense the power too.""";
1380;"Spain,16,6240,""This has a scent of baked apple, and in the mouth, it seems just as much a still white wine as a Cava, with a soft bead that indicates that it's starting to lose steam. Flavors of melon, citrus and pineapple finish with vanilla and chunky weight.""";

1383;"US,1,2300,""Another great Hillside Select from selected blocks in Shafer's vineyard. It's a perfect illustration of the “iron fist in a velvet glove” description of Stags Leap Cabernet, with perhaps more emphasis this year on the velvet than the iron. With smooth tannins and luxurious, oak-influenced blackberry and black cherry jam flavors, it's delicious now and will provide plenty of pleasure over the next 8–10 years.""";
1384;"South Africa,6,4740,""While this is certainly on the higher end of South African Shiraz price points, it's worth the investment. The intense bouquet is loaded with rich dark cherry, raspberry, sweet spice and small wild strawberries. All-spice and pepper dominate the creamy mouth, with opulent flavors of meaty plum, roasted espresso and black cherry guts. Full and powerful in the mouth with a strong vanilla-accented finish. Delicious now but worthy of cellar time as well.""";
1385;"Italy,2,5400,""Red berry, camphor, dried Alpine herb and a whiff of espresso are some of the aromas you'll find on this firmly structured red. On the young, taut palate, assertive fine-grained tannins frame red cherry, star anise and coffee bean. It's still young, with a tight, tongue-drying finish. Drink 2023–2033.""";
1386;"France,671,201300,""You can tell the age from the color and the faded mushroom flavors on the palate. It does merit some passing interest as a wine from the very hot 2003 vintage, but that's about all.""";
1387;"US,325,169000,""Young winemaker Collin Cranor's best Cabernet to date, intense and rounded by savory black cherry, still wound tight but already showing off its oak, sage and tobacco goodness. The wine is well-structured and rich in vanilla and blackberry, a testament to the winemaker's close workings with grower Julio Covarrubias.""";
1388;"France,21,33600,""With the amalgamation of Château Magdelaine into this one property, the estate is now a considerable 58 acres. The wine is now performing in top gear. Powerful tannins drive the mainly Merlot blend with 10% Cabernet Franc. It still shows signs of the wood aging and these will disappear to leave a richly endowed wine with a fine future. Drink from 2026.""";
1389;"Moldova,6,960,""This Moldovan blend of 55% Merlot and 45% Cabernet Sauvignon is aged for 12 months in French barrels and has aromas of mint, smoke, black plum and cassis in the bouquet. In the mouth, there are flavors of black cherry preserves and black currant before the bright fruit finish.""";
1390;"Spain,1,3030,""Jammy, creamy and superripe, with raspberry, burnt toast and coffee on the thick, meaty nose. Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine. It pushes the envelope on ripeness, but that's become the Cirsion way. An awesome wine that deserves a proper decanting.""";
1391;"Spain,25,9250,""Yeasty, bready aromas reflect time in the bottle, although for a gran reserva this is still young. Depth and cushion are present on a slightly foamy palate, while this wine is less about ripe fruit flavors and more about sourdough and fermented citrus notes prior to a lasting finish.""";
1392;"Argentina,1,1900,""Young, fiery and rugged on the nose, but with exotic notes that suggest Middle Eastern and Asian herbs and spices. Like all Cobos Malbecs, this is big, chewy, brawny and a touch medicinal, with powerful dark fruit flavors, particularly black cherry, and a good deal of licorice, chocolate and overall richness. Handles its 15% alcohol better than many heavyweights";
1393;"Italy,247,185250,""You'll find aromas suggesting leather, mature dark-skinned fruit, moist earth and a whiff of game on this brawny red. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, raisin, licorice and tobacco alongside close-grained tannins that grip the finish.""";
1394;"Argentina,3,2550,""This ultraripe Malbec-led blend suggests aged P. X. Sherry via raisin and citrus peel aromas. A jammy palate manages to exhibit balance, despite heavy ripeness, while flavors of blackberry, cassis and prune are dark and dense. A savory, warm, saturated finish continues the theme of maximum ripeness. Drink through 2020.""";
1395;"Italy,581,232400,""You can't go wrong with this Amarone from one of the area's most storied houses. It always shows consistent quality and the 2010 is no exception.

1396;"New Zealand,53,7420,""Wines like this are why Americans can't get enough Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Passion fruit and nectarine are joined by spicy hints of jalapeño, creating a fine balance of round, tropical fruit with peppery piquancy that leaves the mouth watering.""";

1398;"Italy,1,5950,""This stunning wine is all about extreme elegance and subtlety. It opens with aromas of wild red berry, rose petal, sweet baking spice and a whiff aromatic herb while the focused palate delivers red cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, pipe tobacco and white pepper. A firm backbone of polished tannins and vibrant acidity gives it an age-worthy structure. It's loaded with finesse and should develop even more complexity over time. Drink 2018–2033.""";

Drink sooner rather than later.""";
1402;"Italy,15,13350,""Violet, leather, dark berry, clove, menthol and grilled herb aromas lead the nose. The vibrant palate offers crunchy cherry, raspberry jelly, cinnamon and licorice alongside bright acidity. A backbone of assertive but noble tannins provides support. Drink 2018–2030.""";

1408;"France,3,4590,""This wine is soft and rounded with attractive red-cherry fruits, ripe strawberries and touches of wood and tannin. Acidity comes along behind this richness. It is going to develop quickly and will give great pleasure. Drink from 2018.""";
1409;"France,2,3420,""The latest release of the legendary Comtes de Champagne comes from a great vintage. It has full, toasty bottle-age notes that give the wine depth of flavor, with a ripe, rounded mouthfeel and taut acidity. An almond note combines with the citrus-driven acidity on the finish.""";
1410;"France,13,22750,""This wine is characterized by both structure and rich fruitiness. A dark, smoky character brings out the solid tannins that underlie the black currant fruitiness and the balance. Although it doesn't have power, an intensity gives a flavor that lasts in the mouth. Drink this wine from 2018.""";
1411;"Chile,5,7500,""Warm-vintage characteristics of earthy berry aromas require time to come into focus. In the mouth, this Cabernet Sauvignon blend feels ripe, chunky and lush.

1412;"Austria,3,2370,""Right now, although the nose is closed, exposure to air reveals the purity of lemon oil on a taut and tight palate still singing with yeasty notes.

1414;"New Zealand,2,1120,""This shows really attractive floral notes on the nose, followed by smoldering, dark flavors of roasted root vegetables and caramelized black cherries. It's full-bodied and maybe even a bit chunky on the palate, so give it until 2016–2017 to settle down and smooth out.""";
1415;"Italy,8,8640,""Toast, moist underbrush, grilled herb and balsamic aromas lead the nose. On the full-bodied austere palate, fine-grained tannins support tart cherry, cranberry, vanilla and star anise. Give this several more years to unwind and develop. Drink 2013–2033.""";

1417;"Germany,11,7480,""Smoke and earth lend a savory tone to fresh apple and lemon aromas on this dry, intensely concentrated Riesling. It's bold and weighty on the palate, but energized by a strike of lemon-lime acidity and soft white peach tones that linger on the finish.""";
1418;"Israel,4,2240,""With only 2,940 bottles produced, this is a limited-edition wine that's worth the hunt. Vanilla and oaky spice aromas immediately waft from the glass, with the core of dark berries and fleshy plum fruit following shortly after. Heavy and bold on the palate, the firm structure complements the concentrated blackberry and cherry flavors. Nuances of cocoa powder and tea leaves linger on the close.""";
1419;"Uruguay,1,650,""A lot has been thrown at this Tannat, and thus it's oaky while smelling like dried aged cheese and charred black plum. This is exceedingly tannic and acidic, so mouthfeel is an issue. Saucy, high-toned acid-driven tomato, herb and sour plum flavors finish sharp and tangy.""";
1420;"Israel,4,1320,""Violet-red in the glass, this wine has a nose of blackberries and gingerbread spice.

1421;"France,25,1750,""This wine is ripe with dense blackberry fruits and some firm, dry smoky tannins. It has the fruitiness and acidity typical of the vintage, along with some depth of flavor and a smooth aftertaste. Drink from 2017.""";
1422;"Hungary,3,1500,""Lush, opulent aromas of tropical fruit, spice and honey lead this Tokaji from Hungary. On the palate, the wine is supple and unctuous without heaviness, coating the tongue with more pineapple, orange and honey and finishing off with a delicious, lingering finesse.""";

1424;"South Africa,3,2100,""There's a spicy soul to this beautiful Syrah, as forward notes of white pepper, licorice and sweet spice abound on the nose and mouth, infusing the raspberry, cherry and brambly blackberry fruits throughout.

Medium weight, the approachable palate boasts a crushed satin texture, with fine yet gripping tannins that hang on through the spicy finish. Drink now–2020.""";

1427;"Italy,114,47880,""Zanna Riserva is a delicious wine with oak tones of chocolate and vanilla bean that are backed by touches of black fruit, currant, leather and spice. It finishes with soft, plump density and loads of black fruit and plum. Very nice.""";
1428;"Italy,1,1220,""Vigna La Rosa is always among Fontanafredda's best performing wines and this vintage will appeal to those who enjoy a riper, fuller style of Barolo.

1429;"England,3,1290,""Notions of tart redcurrant play on the nose while a delicious edge of white pepper draws you in. The same pepper entices on the palate, framing fresh, tart berry and lemon purity on the slender but memorable palate. A firm structure makes this spicy, energetic and invigorating little number irresistible. The fine mousse has verve and elegance. It finishes pure and long.""";
1430;"Spain,1,3250,""Hard to believe the price on this. Yes, it's a perfectly good aged Ribera, but special it isn't. Bricky and roasted on the nose, with spiced cherry and plum aromas. The palate is healthy and comfortable, with cola, cherry and licorice flavors. Vanilla and length define the finish. Too regular to recommend at $325.""";

1434;"Chile,3,1260,""This blend of six grapes is led by Cabernet Sauvignon. On the bouquet, it's dry and dusty, with tobacco, cherry and a hint of raisin. The palate feels a touch baked and/or cooked, while reedy, minty, lightly herbal flavors are offset by cassis and berry. Mild astringency defines the finish.""";
1435;"Mexico,1,100,""Smells crisp and pineapple-y and tastes of tart pineapple and pear, but the mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. Finishes relatively clean and tangy.""";
1436;"Greece,20,3800,""Vanilla, strawberry and cherry on the nose leads into a spicy but balanced blend of fresh and fruity flavors. The wine offers ample minerality so it's clean on the tongue. Delightful and flirty, and good with fruit desserts.""";
1437;"Brazil,13,1950,""Tropical aromas of lime and lychee are simple but also normal for Moscato. This semisweet still wine is a bit dilute, with flavors of sweet grass, green herbs and lychee.""";
1438;"Mexico,4,800,""This rusty looking, aged Cabernet Sauvignon displays mature, cooked aromas of prune, raisin and not much else. The mouthfeel is dry and astringent, while flavors of burnt brown sugar, stewed berry and turned earth finish quick, without any backup.""";
1439;"Chile,1,2600,""Round, dark and impressive, with deep berry aromas, minerality, smokiness and a hint of herbs and tomato.

Drink now through 2017.""";
1440;"Slovenia,1,380,""Ripe and rich in texture, this powerful Slovenian Cabernet balances a bold black-cherry flavor with loads of savory dried herb, graphite and reverberating acidity.

1441;"Italy,15,30000,""You'll recognize this Sangiovese immediately thanks to pristine notes of blue flowers, chalky soil, sage and Mediterranean herbs. It has a thinner, delicate texture in the mouth but ends with bright, vibrant crispness.""";
1442;"Canada,10,3500,""This unique, port-style dessert wine fortifies its Marechal Foch, Cabernet Franc and Merlot base with walnut brandy.

Drink now through 2018.""";
1447;"New Zealand,1,620,""It is a dark and earthy Pinot, with notes of clean compost, root beer and faint hints of campfire. This medium- to full-bodied wine boasts supple tannins that coast easily through a long, silky finish. Tasted from a 3L bottle in Central Otago (nonblind), the wine seemed much fresher, with more cherry fruit.""";
1448;"Italy,2,6400,""Here's a “wow” wine you won't easily forget. Messorio is all Merlot, and happily delivers the softness, richness and overall opulence that we love in this noble grape variety.

This is a huge wine, but it's not exaggerated and the finish is as long and smooth as they come.""";

1453;"Argentina,28,7840,""Weinert has always pushed the more traditional, less extracted style. And this Bordeaux blend shows a nose of light spice, cinnamon, wet clay and subdued berry fruit. The palate is earthy, with hints of tomato, herbs, raspberry and cocoa. It's a drying wine, with grabby tannins, but it should age well for another few years. Drink now or hold through 2011.""";
1454;"Chile,1,470,""Gritty aromas of compost, animal hide, burnt beef and leather set up a pinching palate. Like the nose, this Carignan tastes gritty, sharp, foxy and like tart plum. A salty finish with little ripeness is grabby on the way out.""";
1455;"France,53,24380,""Wood and fruit tannins push through strongly in this powerful wine. It has weight and plush fruit texture, and behind the tannins, dark chocolate and licorice flavors. It's dense and concentrated, needing several years, at least 5–6, to shine.""";

It is bright on entry, followed by a sophisticated sense of chalkiness with intense flavors of peach, nectarine, brioche, guava and honeysuckle. Flashes of brightness on the finish dissipate the firm tannins on the palate.""";
1458;"Italy,104,35360,""You'll find aromas of stewed prune, resin and nail polish remover on this ripe, robust red. The dense, brooding and extremely astringent palate offers raisin, game, anise and a dried herb. Abrasive tannins leave a rough, dried out finish.""";
1459;"Austria,119,21420,""Zesty flavours of both yeast and grapefruit dominate the nose, they are joined on the palate by peppery, even more yeasty freshness. This is fresh and zippy, but generous, too, and fizzes ever so slightly.""";
1460;"Canada,2,980,""This wine plays out broadly across the palate, showing tart berries and espresso components, along with a whiff of asparagus. The fruit is somewhat thin and front-loaded, with barrel flavors of toast and cigar box masking some—not all—of the herbaceousness.""";
1461;"South Africa,6,2580,""This is a wine with presence, from its meaty, spicy nose to its big, full-flavored fruit and spice character.

1462;"Spain,1,2480,""With the exact same rating as the awesome 2004, this new vintage of Aurus is an unbridled winner. It's a little creamy and sweet on first blush, but time and air reveals its darker, more serious side. Flavors of blackberry, barbecued beef and fudge tell all you need to know about ripeness and richness, and among the new classics of Rioja, Aurus is one of the leaders.

1464;"England,2,880,""Evocative redcurrant notes play on the nose. They become more intense on the palate where lively fizz lets them mix with lemon and pink grapefruit zestiness. This wine is lively and fresh but the exuberant surface is supported by a firm and taut structure of subtle autolysis that provides the perfect backdrop for all the tart, refreshing berry fruit. It offers freshness, joy and verve in one tidy, neat package. Lovely now, it will develop. Drink 2017–2025.""";
1465;"US,1,1170,""Acidity and hard tannins dominate this bone dry Bordeaux blend, locking it down into bitterness and astringency. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's also very oaky.

1469;"Lebanon,3,1200,""This Lebanese white starts with aromas of honey, peach and lemon, offering like flavors in a viscous blend on the palate. Some spice offers lift, but overall the wine has a richer character. A pretty, unfolding finish.""";
1470;"Austria,8,4240,""There is a citrus purity on the nose that suggests fresh lemon juice, but it is tempered by some spice, like that of still-green Seville orange rind.

1471;"Italy,1,5400,""Beautifully balanced, this opens with alluring scents of wild berry, rose, baking spice and whiffs of chopped herb. Seamlessly combining ripe fruit and the firm's trademark finesse, the bright elegantly structured palate delivers juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and a hint of black tea framed in polished tannins and fresh acidity. It's already tempting but the best is yet to come. Drink 2021–2031.""";

1481;"Uruguay,4,520,""Woody berry aromas are solid but standard. This blend of Marselán, Tannat and Merlot is hard as nails, with rubbery tannins. Saucy plum flavors are green and spicy, while this shows abrasive residual tannins on a firm but limited finish.""";
1482;"Spain,11,15400,""With an opaque purple color and gritty, reduced aromas of grapy black fruits and hot stones, this hard, tannic, impermeable Tinto Fino tastes of lemony oak, baked blackberry and herbs. A dark, charred finish with notes of shoe polish and licorice is intense. Overall, this is fully extracted, concentrated and on the cusp of overdone. Drink through 2020.""";
1483;"France,39,28080,""With time, fresh rose petals merge into heady Turkish delight notes on the nose. This is full-on Gewurztraminer with all the bells and whistles: utterly decadent rose water and honeysuckle notes are submerged in rich, indulgent sweetness. This is perfumed and full-on: a super-charged varietal expression with rich, powdery layers of rose, honey and caramel.""";
1484;"Italy,48,52800,""Very characteristic of the 2008 vintage, this young Brunello opens with soft and round aromas of cherry and blackberry backed by delicate tones of spice and tobacco. Once the wine hits the palate, you will feel that bright acidity that is so typical of Sangiovese Grosso.""";
1485;"Italy,3,2130,""Vaio Armaron is an elegant and sophisticated wine that exhibits deep complexity and aromatic intensity. Thanks to its pretty layers of red cherry, spice and cola this wine exemplifies the best of classic Amarone tradition. It makes a fabulous winter wine to be paired with beef stew or roasts.""";
1486;"Germany,1,2450,""Exceeds even this producer's stunning beerenauslese, featuring an even more intoxicating perfume of honey, dried apricots and candied pineapple, with slightly more acidity to provide balance to the extra level of sweetness, so much so that this wine comes across as refreshing on the finish, despite the incredibly high levels of sugar. Drink now–2050, possibly longer.""";
1487;"France,345,172500,""Wood aging for 18 months has smoothed out the natural tannins of this Pommard while retaining the concentration of the 30-year-old vines. The wine is rich, soft, full of blackberry fruitiness and maturing well, ready to be drunk from 2015.""";
1488;"Greece,15,4500,""Violet, crushed herb and mint aromas start this Agiorgitiko. On the palate, coca, vanilla, red berry and a savory spin give it depth. Fresh and friendly but substantive, this wine can age.""";
1489;"Germany,1,2360,""Two years of aging on the lees renders incredible textural dimension to this decadently silky dry Riesling. Fresh white grapefruit, lime and lemon notes shine on the palate, offsetting expansive mouthfeel, with acidity that's focused and precise. Stunning already, but should evolve dramatically through 2025.""";
1490;"Portugal,174,24360,""Wood-aged wine that shows pedigree and style. It has red berry fruit flavors, firm tannins along with acidity and a dry core. It's a serious wine, for aging over 4–5 years.""";

1494;"France,10,12800,""This vineyard is at the heart of the fine run of premier crus that lie midway up the slope above the village.

Drink from 2017.""";
1495;"Uruguay,1,1300,""Dense, cedary, rubbery aromas of blackberry and turned earth set up a lush, clean, chewy palate full of ripe flavors of blueberry, prune, raisin and fig.

1498;"South Africa,11,880,""You can't beat the price of this simple, quaffable red from Oak Lane, and certainly this is a wine that could make for very nice everyday sipping.

1499;"Germany,5,3550,""Smoke and savory nut aromas dissipate to reveal a dramatic backdrop of rose petal and peach on the nose of this dry, full-bodied Riesling. The palate is generously textured, with a rich, creamy mouthfeel, but finishes elegantly, with a murmur of lime-pith astringency.""";
1500;"Portugal,2,1280,""This is a smooth, ripe and rich wine. It has tannins that give structure and are also well integrated into the generous blackberry and dark plum fruits.

Drink this complex, serious wine from 2018.""";
1501;"Argentina,126,20160,""Woodsy raisin and cassis aromas are closed and a bit chemical. This feels solid, round and resiny, with wood-driven flavors of raspberry, plum and oak-related spices. Dry and resiny feeling on the finish.""";

1504;"England,1,380,""A lifting mix of golden, ripe apple, chamomile, moss and honey signals richness and some maturity. The palate is poised and holds all of these flavours tightly in a soaring, slender structure that is built on a firm foundation of bright acidity and subtle earthiness. Grown-up, taut, generous and poised, this is a honey-edged homage to the South Downs.""";
1505;"Germany,1,1300,""Filled with minerality, spice and everything nice, this incredibly intense wine is also filled with honey, gently caramelized peaches and citrus. It's got huge presence on the palate and a virtually endless, sweet finish. It should evolve gracefully for 50 or more years.""";
1506;"Australia,1,1190,""Octavius has always been oaky, but over the years the fruit has come into better balance, and the 2009 may be one of the most successful editions yet released. It's dense and impenetrable at first, only slowly yielding hints of plum, mocha and vanilla. The texture is rich and supple enough to make the wine approachable now, but it should evolve and improve through 2020 or beyond.""";
1507;"France,35,49000,""With some age, this bone-dry wine has softened and filled out. There's still a lemon aroma as well as crisp acidity on the palate, but they are less tight now, rounded and with a fine balance between fruit and acidity. It is still a year off maturity, so wait until 2018.""";
1508;"France,2,3220,""This wine is tight and closed up. It does suggest plenty of fruit weight, hinting at toast and apple flavors that will come through over the next several years to give a rich wine. Drink from 2022.""";
1509;"France,4,15200,""This is an opulent wine from one of the fabled series of white Grand Crus. Along with generous yellow fruits and ripe citrus, it has weight and gravitas.

1510;"Germany,1,910,""Bold in alcohol, with a dry, intensely textured palate, this Riesling is rich and ripe, with notes of honeysuckle, peach and even a hint of berry.

1513;"US,1923,865350,""Zin doesn't get bigger or riper than this. Floods the mouth with flamboyant blackberries, cherries, currants, cola, black pepper, anise and sandalwood. It's tannic and dry, but so fruity it's almost sweet. High alcohol aids in the impression of sweetness. Oaky, too, in the way of a Cabernet. Delicious and classic Dry Creek.""";
1514;"Australia,70,13300,""Yalumba pioneered Viognier in Australia and the current crop of wines testifies to the company's efforts.

1517;"Chile,2,1560,""Ripe, smooth and pure, with aromas of asphalt, tobacco and cedar-lined cigar box along with dry, elevated fruit. The palate is balanced to a tee, with floral, fresh flavors of berry, cola, herbs and tobacco. Seña has been on a roll lately, and this vintage is entirely inviting, balanced and savory. Drinkable now, but best from 2010 to 2013.""";
1518;"Spain,4,6200,""This is a powerful, rich, toasty Garnacha, with grit, earth and spice galore on the bouquet. It feels tough, masculine and tannic, with a mix of beefy black-fruit flavors elevated by molasses and spice.

1519;"Greece,7,3150,""This subtle, elegant sip starts with aromas of spicebox, tobacco and rich dark fruit, followed by flavors of cherry, cedar and cinnamon spice. A softer style, integrated red that will pair well with duck, steak.""";
1520;"Germany,1,3760,""Perhaps a step behind Weil's other supersweet 2009s, this eiswein remains a prodigious effort. The candied pineapple and golden raisin notes are so intense, so concentrated that they're almost painful to taste, lingering virtually forever on the finish.""";
1521;"Germany,6,4800,""While the nose is buoyant, bursting with honey, mango and flowers, a polished elegance reverberates throughout this dry, steely Riesling. Rich in body and texture, it's ripe and peachy, yet balanced with streaks of lime, lemon and mineral. The finish rolls endlessly on the palate.""";
1522;"Portugal,4,3080,""This is more of a chunky, rich tawny";
1523;"Croatia,2,1300,""There's so much nuance and complexity in this rustic yet fascinating Croatian wine, that it takes a while to break down its components. Initial scents of dried leaves and mulch blow off to reveal an array of delicate floral and fruit aromas, accented by rich chocolate and vanilla notes. Big in both alcohol and structure, its massively tannic, but smoothes out with aeration. Decant to drink now, but could easily evolve for 5–10 years.""";
1524;"France,6,11400,""This is massive, hugely concentrated, topped with wood and intense tannins. Flavors of bitter chocolate are dominant, heavy fruits, blackberries and texture that fills the mouth with dark, dense flavors. Big in all senses.""";
1525;"France,1,4630,""Still way too young, this is developing into a substantial and structured wine. Full of both fruit and tannins, it is dark and dense, very dry at this stage but with the most enticing perfumes. The Grand Cru, split between Chambolle-Musigny and Morey Saint-Denis, is known for its structure and this wine is a great example. Drink from 2020.""";
1526;"Israel,2,940,""A smooth, velvety textured wine, full of slightly overripe dark cherry, raspberry and plum with accents of cassis, tea and spice that thrill the palate. Closing with a clean and silky finish, this wine is sure to be a crowd pleaser. It's 60% Cab, 30% Merlot and 10% Shiraz.""";
1527;"Australia,107,26750,""Wow—talk about contrasts. The nose is way over the top, a grotesque parody of a butterscotch sundae. The finish is multilayered and complex, featuring echoes of toast and white peaches. In between is a somewhat neutral-tasting wine. You may love it or you may hate it—it's that kind of wine.""";
1528;"Austria,43,25800,""Yeasty, almost umami-like spice slowly yields to ripe, delicious apricot flavors. The generosity is toned by bright lemon freshness that runs right through this concentrated wine and provides satisfying length. There is a delicious aftertaste of crunchy apple.""";

1531;"Chile,1,680,""The Carmenère in this Carm-Cabernet-Syrah blend is the lead singer, so expect a touch of minty green and herbal essence. It's a heavyweight in the sense that the mouthfeel is big and the tannins are a little hard. But with airing it unveils classy, spicy berry flavors and wood-based accents of vanilla and butter (20 months in new oak will do that). A big wine that needs some airing. Ready now but can rest well in the cellar for a few more years.""";
1532;"Spain,359,43080,""Zesty cherry aromas are offset by powdery softness and floral hints. This feels solid and correct, with bright acidity. Flavors of red-apple skins and citrus fruits finish direct and clean.""";
1533;"Mexico,1,1000,""Price aside, this is a ponderous wine with rooty aromas of Dr. Pepper mixed with burnt toast, coffee and baked berry fruits. It's very rich and syrupy in the mouth, while caramel, chocolate and baked berry flavors bring this overripe wine to rest.""";
1534;"Mexico,2,700,""This opens with hard-capped aromas of crusty mineral and reedy berry. The flavors are gamy and roasted, with brandied plum and cherry accents. The finish is bright in feel and runs long with an herbal raspberry flavor.""";
1535;"Moldova,3,1140,""Made from 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Saperavi and 5% Rara Neagra, this wine has a nose of leather, cherry, black raspberry, fig and black plum. Flavors of fresh fig, spice and black plum slowly dissipate on the enduring finish.""";
1536;"France,3,14250,""With its high proportion of Cabernet Franc (45%), this is a finely perfumed rich wine. It has great tannins, a smoky character that comes from the wood. The tannins are quite marked, giving a tight firm edge to the wine that otherwise has generous fruitiness. This is a complex wine, impressive, and likely to age over many years. Drink from 2028.""";
1537;"US,3,18750,""We can debate the pricing on Yao Ming's new reserve, but what's undeniable, by any modern standard, is the wine's excellence. A blend of fruit from Atlas Peak and Rutherford, the wine is a barrel selection from the winery's regular 2010 output, and accounts for only about 20% of total production. The Cabernet Sauvignon is mixed with a little Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It's delicious in blackberry, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and oak flavors, and well structured in acids and tannins. The wine should develop in the bottle for at least 10 years.""";
1538;"South Africa,1,1300,""One of the finest selections from South Africa today, Sadie's 2011 Columella is structured, complex and masterfully balanced, ready for a beautiful, long life ahead.

1540;"Hungary,1,120,""Delicate in scent, this has aromas of bright cherry and violet. This semisweet Blaufränkisch bursts on the palate with fresh red-cherry and strawberry flavors. Juicy and cheerful, it finishes with a hint of caramelized sugar.""";
1541;"Italy,2,8800,""This is an elegant Nebbiolo-based wine and arguably the most feminine of Gaja's newest releases. There's extreme balance and sophistication evident in the focused aromas of wild berry, white licorice, pressed violets and polished stone. The mouthfeel is tight, firm and those tannins need at least 10 more years to soften in your cellar. Beautiful.""";
1542;"Australia,3,2010,""This is a crisp, tart and somewhat ungenerous example of Australian Pinot Noir. It's lean and wiry, with a solid sinew of pie-cherry fruit, so maybe it just needs time, as it seems otherwise well made.""";
1543;"Spain,256,23040,""Yeasty, slightly stalky aromas of melon, citrus and peach are simple yet fresh. This feels solid, pulpy and fleshy, but not flabby";
1544;"France,143,107250,""Wood aromas are repeated on the palate with a dry bitterness. This wine should soften as it develops, although that over-enthusiastic use of wood could remain. This is one of several Bordeaux estates owned by André Lurton.""";
1545;"France,1,11250,""While it starts austerely, this wine is obviously going to be a powerhouse of red plum and other ripe red fruits. The aromas are smoky, and this also shows in the palate as the wine fills with juicy richness, finishing with tight acidity. Give it 5–10 years.""";
1546;"Canada,1,750,""The Vidal Gold Icewine starts with an enticing nose of tropical fruit, honey and spice. Mouthfilling, intense flavors of peach, mango and apricot follow, balanced by crisp acidity. Clean but complex, the wine unfolds extravagantly on the palate. The wine can age and will intensify as time passes.""";
1547;"Italy,325,78000,""You'll find aromas of tomato leaf, passion fruit, crushed rock and green bell pepper on this radiant white. The bright, savory palate delivers tropical fruit, tangerine zest, dill, celery and mineral alongside tangy acidity. It's an extremely impressive showing for this challenging vintage.""";
1548;"Chile,1,770,""Powerful and entering its mature stage. Aromas on this Cab-Carmenère blend are typically earthy and lightly baked, with leaf, tobacco and nutmeg accents. Feels solid and ready, with rooty berry, olive, cocoa and vanilla flavors setting up a spicy, earthy finish. A fine wine if you can tolerate some classic Chilean olive and tobacco qualities.""";
1549;"Portugal,7,2170,""Very true to the variety, this is a soft, barnyardy, raspberry flavored wine. With its ripe fruit and well integrated tannins, it has a smooth mouthfeel that is freshened with acidity on the finish.""";
1550;"Brazil,1,280,""Stale fruit and damp-earth aromas are a warning sign. In the mouth, this Cabernet Sauvignon is raw and acidic, with hard tannins. Lean plum flavors are oaky and resiny, while this feels scratchy on an intensely dry finish.""";
1551;"Morocco,14,2520,""This wine offers aromas of rose petal and geranium with a hint of lemon. It is full on the palate, with flavors of toasted pineapple, white peach, lilac and Turkish delight. The smooth finish is marked by savory touches, with a nice balance of fruit and floral flavors.""";
1552;"New Zealand,2,960,""One of few Kiwi Pinots typically worth cellaring, Neudorf's 2008 Moutere bottling comes across as a bit oaky, with menthol and cedar notes forming a tight overlay to the cherry fruit. Tannins are silky yet firm, suggesting the wine will be at its best 2012–2018.""";
1553;"France,3,4440,""This is a ripe, round and full-bodied wine. It has a touch of nutmeg as well as bright acidity and sliced-apple flavors. It is immediately attractive, richly packed with fruit and finishing with spice and toast.""";
1554;"Greece,12,1200,""Violet, blackberry and plums on the nose are followed by unctuous, dark berry flavors in his affordable red. The wine has body but is buoyed by good structure and acidity. A very god alternative to everyday reds, and with a more mysterious overall character.""";
1555;"New Zealand,3,3000,""This was an interesting showing for Dry River's 2008 Pinot, which seems to be showing more structure now than when I first tasted it last November. Now it's a bit blockier than I remember it, with potent cherry-berry fruit, a bit of vanilla and an long finish that ultimately smooths out and turns silky. Try 2013–2020.""";
1556;"Italy,19,14630,""Wild berry, leather, tobacco, tilled earth, aromatic herb and floral aromas meld together on this impressive red.

Overall, it lacks finesse and nuance.""";

1674;"Spain,1,1380,""Varietal Graciano will never fit into the mold of “tried and true,” but this 2004 from top-level producer Contino shows the grape in its most positive light. The nose is natural, with hints of cola and ripe berries. The feel is brawny and intense, with semi-searing acids offset by ripe tannins. Finishes well, with a cleansing wave of red fruit and citrusy flavors. More of a novelty than anything, but a fine wine in and of itself.""";
1675;"France,2,6080,""Very opulent, very rich, this is a complex, structured wine packed with fruit and brooding tannins. It is already rich, and will develop into a beautifully intense, concentrated and generous wine.""";
1676;"US,518,139860,""Zinfandel is not usually a wine you have to age, but this one does need four years or so in the cellar. It's bone dry and quite good, with classic wild berry, tobacco, grilled meat and spice flavors, but it's pretty tannic. Has the depth and balance to blossom by, say, 2015.""";
1677;"Spain,1,1160,""Always one of Spain's best bubblies, this is precise and dry, with a dusty apple aroma and only a bit of yeast on the bouquet.

1680;"US,232,76560,""Zesty, peppery green notes lend freshness to ripe blackberry aromas on this zippy Cabernet Franc. It's crisp and quaffable yet elegant and serious, framed squarely with fine, firm tannins.""";
1681;"South Africa,1,490,""Big, bold, savory and herbal, this complex Cab starts with aromas of black cherry, cedar and vanilla, rolling out into rich waves of cedar, blackcurrant, herbs and spice.  Masculine and ageable, the wine has a stylish but strudy character and a lingering pepper finish. A wine for the cellar, or to drink now with a juicy steak.""";
1682;"Argentina,2,1040,""Opaque and thick, with all types of black fruit aromas blending with smoked meat scents and toasty darkness. The body is fleshy and extracted, with raw tannins and a clacky feel. Tastes woody and baked, with blackberry, licorice and sweet plum flavors. Turns herbal and minty on the finish.""";
1683;"Portugal,1,4500,""This is the latest release of what has long been regarded as Portugal's iconic wine. And it is magnificent. The last vintage was the 2004 and the wait has now shown to be worthwhile. With its immense span and breadth of flavors and rich structure it is a superb manifestation of the great vineyards of the Douro Superior. Big bold fruits and acidity are matched by the tannins and concentration. Hold this for many years or at least wait until 2022.""";

1685;"France,1,12000,""Solid, very structured, packed with dense and dry tannins. There is a core of acidity and darkness that gives the wine a brooding, powerful character. At this stage, it seems austere although it does have the weight of fruit typical of the year.""";
1686;"Greece,39,5850,""Vibrant tropical fruit and citrus on the nose start this poised white from Greece. Pineapple, lemon and banana flavors are balanced by refreshing acidity and minerality. Overall, the wine is a delicious blend of fresh and fruity. A great find.""";
1687;"Italy,461,161350,""Zibibbo is usually presented as a passito dessert wine, but this is dry. The natural floral fragrance of the variety emerges on the nose, while the mouthfeel and the honey and peach flavors are detailed with acids.""";

1690;"France,1,9730,""Produced from vines mainly planted in the 1970s, this is a concentrated dark wine. Rich and ripe, it has powerful tannins mingled with beautifully perfumed fruits. The wine is dense and packed with floral fruitiness as well as fine, sweet tannins. Drink from 2025.""";
1691;"Spain,2,2860,""Roasted meat, leather, animal and stout berry aromas make for an inviting bouquet.

Drink now–2018";
1692;"France,275,77000,""Yeasty funk still obscures the aromas on the nose. The palate, however, speaks of fluid freshness, of richness and power channelled into precision and softness.

The length just gets you.""";
1693;"Moldova,1,420,""This Icewine is a blend of Muscat, Ottonel and Traminer. It presents the nose with caramelized pineapple, lemon curd and lemon meringue pie. It is fairly sweet on the palate with a mixture of lemon grass, sweet lime rind and lemon curd.""";
1694;"Australia,5,11250,""Winemaker Dave Powell is no longer with Torbreck, but the 2007 RunRig is one of his finest efforts. The complexity is almost overwhelming, as the aromas range from peppery spice and roasted meat to blueberry and tappanade.

1695;"France,2,9200,""This wine is dark and structured, offering ripe fruits although they are covered at this stage by the tannins. Firm and dense, with a dry core, this will be a powerful wine full of black fruits and concentration. Drink this from 2023.""";
1696;"South Africa,2,620,""This limited release is big and flavorful upfront, with assertive aromas of sweet spice, clementine, tropical fruit and blanched almonds. A fleshy pear flavor leads the round, mouth-filling palate, followed by a lengthy finish laced with notes of hazelnut toast and sweet spice. Ready to drink now.""";
1697;"Portugal,11,4620,""This wood-aged wine is soft and round. Touches of spice and vanilla partner with warm pear and peach flavors. It is still young, still integrating the wood with the fruit. Drink from 2016.""";
1698;"US,37,30340,""You can taste the California sun in every sip of this gorgeous Pinot Noir. It brims with luscious raspberries and cherries accented by brisk acidity and a hint of sweet, smoky oak. It's terrifically complex, with notes of mushroom, orange zest, cola, rosehip tea and persimmon. Dry and elegant, with a wonderful mouthfeel, it's gorgeous now, but will gain earthy complexity over the next 15 years.""";
1699;"Germany,1,1250,""Hints of caramel and vanilla, along with soft, silky tannins add oaky, woodsy warmth to the brambly flavors of red raspberry and cherry. It's delicately structured, with bracing acidity that adds levity and zip, highlighting the tart berry notes on the finish.""";
1700;"Austria,20,9200,""Wonderfully ripe notions of juicy, yellow pear rise from the glass. The same fruity freshness is joined on the palate by a good pinch of white pepper.

1701;"Argentina,153,27540,""Woody aromas of tree bark, forest floor and earthy, minty berry fruits lead to a full and stocky feeling palate with wiry, herbal, oak-heavy flavors of plum and mint. On the finish, this is tannic, with strong spice notes and a hint of green.""";
1702;"France,1181,236200,""Young, fresh and fruity, this wine is bright and attractive. It has a strong juicy element along with red-currant liveliness and only a touch of tannins. It will mature early, so drink from the end of 2016.""";
1703;"Italy,47,32430,""Wild-berry, truffle, leather, menthol and sunbaked soil aromas lead the way. Tightly wound but ripe tannins wrap around the firmly structured palate, underscoring mature Morello cherry, black raspberry, white pepper, licorice and chopped Mediterranean herb. A subtle hint of game closes the finish. Drink 2019–2026.""";
1704;"Argentina,21,6720,""While Argentine Malbecs aren't textbook cellaring wines, this one has enough spirit, tannin and structure to benefit from a few years on its side. Now, it's lush on the nose, with ripe berry, pencil eraser, vanilla and marzipan aromas. The palate is chewy but well built, with dense blackberry, cassis, coconut and chocolate flavors. On the finish, things only intensify. Will be at its best around 2015–2016.""";
1705;"Italy,9,14850,""You really can't beat the beauty of this Barolo. Rich, enduring and persistent, it offers a long array of blackberry, spice and cola-like aromas. The mouthfeel is spectacular thanks to a velvety texture that is backed by a pretty embroidery of cassis, licorice and spicy ginger flavors. Give this 10–15 more years of aging.""";
1706;"Spain,4,1640,""This is a bit mulchy and leathery on the nose, with stalky berry aromas. The heavy palate feels wide, with pointed acidity, bearing soupy flavors of vanilla and cream. It finishes with lots of flavor but a syrupy feel.""";
1707;"Croatia,3,630,""While just a touch ripe on the nose, this rosé is wonderfully dry with a bright red plum and cherry compote palate accented by deep, stony minerality. Full bodied, yet pleasantly astringent on the finish, it's the perfect accompaniment to seafood.""";
1708;"New Zealand,2,1020,""The 2011 Mate's Vineyard appears to have more focus and drive than the Hunting Hill, but fewer curves. Toasted nuts garnish pineapple and tangerine fruit, while the finish is long, tight and richly textured. This should be long-lived by New Zealand Chardonnay standards";
1709;"Germany,1,3330,""The numbers on this wine are amazing (380 g/l residual sugar, 17 g/l TA), but even more impressive is how such an extremely sweet wine can remain reasonably drinkable, complex and harmonious. It's musky and spice-laden, filled with dried apricot and honey flavors that linger on the incredibly long, citrusy finish. Should age indefinitely.""";
1710;"South Africa,14,9100,""This world-class blend of 52% Cabernet Franc, 20% Malbec, 13% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot is concentrated, structured and powerful, with the promise of a long life ahead. Earthy, herbal streaks of cigar box, licorice root, char and minty fynbos frame the lush fruit core of muddled boysenberry, black raspberry, plum and currant. The palate is bold and assertively flavored, with good evolution from jammy black fruit to earthy spice and finally leather and toast on the finish. Drink 2018–2024.""";
1711;"Peru,2,300,""Roasted and earthy smelling, with a pinch of iodine and even a whiff of bacon or ham. Rich, full and a touch sticky on the tongue, with baked berry and chocolate flavors. Mellow and sweet on the back end. 100% Malbec.""";
1712;"Australia,3,1380,""Impressive for its bold, savory flavors of tapenade and grilled meat, this is full boded and ripe, but lacks the density and concentration of the region's best examples, giving way to an open-knit finish. Drink this over the next several years for its upfront appeal.""";
1713;"Australia,1,820,""The vineyard was planted in 1853, so these are some seriously old vines, yielding seriously concentrated fruit.

1716;"Morocco,1,170,""From the first whiff of cherry, cranberry and caramel you know you are in for a treat. Flavors of clove, marzipan and grilled peach add nuance to the red fruit driven palate. The smooth tannins persist without overpowering the bright fruit and spice tones.""";
1717;"Australia,3,1590,""Mint marks the nose of this otherwise darkly attractive wine. Notes of mocha and plum nicely set up the wine, as do the supple tannins, but then there's a jarring edge of prickly acidity that cuts across the palate and disrupts the flow. There are some nice parts here that don't quite come together.""";
1718;"Italy,4,4160,""This beautiful expression of Nebbiolo from the Cannubi cru opens with elegant and defined aromas of forest fruit, white chocolate, drying minerals, violets and moderate, spicy barbecue-like aromas. The wine shows excellent structure and tight, drying tannins that need 5–8 more years of cellar aging.""";
1719;"South Africa,1,460,""This opens with attractive earthy aromas of forest floor, cola, vanilla bean and toasted spice, grounded in a core of red currant, cherry and raspberry fruit. The medium-weight mouthfeel is lush and seductive, with fine yet structured tannins that result in a satiny texture. Pure fruit flavors dominate the palate, but the finish is layered with notes of white pepper, tea leaf and woody spice. Approachable now, but will age well through 2020.""";
1720;"Cyprus,1,110,""This elegant Cypriot white from the monastery of Chrysorroyiatissa offers a blend of complexity and freshness. The clean, lush fruit and citrus flavors are balanced with fresh acidity and a touch of floral sweetness. An intriguing white with class.""";
1721;"France,470,188000,""Youthful, bright red color on this full-bodied, potentially rich wine. With its balance between acidity, black fruits and edgy tannins, the wine from the plateau close to Saumur has all the smoky, tobacco leaf and fragrance of cool climate Cabernet Franc.""";
1722;"Bulgaria,3,390,""This Sauvignon Blanc from Bulgaria's Thracian Valley has bright aromas of lemon grass, citrus blossom and freshly mowed lawn.

1724;"France,115,41400,""Wood aging has given this wine richness as well as a smooth texture. It is a ripe full-bodied wine, finely poised between fruit and more mature secondary flavors. The single vineyard wine is ready to drink.""";
1725;"New Zealand,1,990,""This has the look of a monster. It's dense and dark in color, with brooding aromas of plum and mushroom.

1726;"France,87,42630,""With zero grams of residual sugar, this is wine is as dry as it gets, relying on the ripe fruit to balance the intense acidity. Crisp apple and tight acidity dominate. Like many zero-dosage Champagnes it needs to age, so hold this bottle for two years.""";
1727;"Germany,40,15200,""While the nose opens with intense mineral tones of smoke and petrol, the palate of this kabinett bursts with plump melon and stone fruit. Zesty and bright, it's a deeply complex and irresistibly quaffable wine, with satisfying sweetness on the finish.""";

1771;"Australia,18,7560,""To judge by the aromas—a complex herbal mélange containing hints of cabbage leaf, tea and acacia blossom—this includes a healthy proportion of stems.

1774;"Germany,29,9280,""Zesty grapefruit and tangerine aromas mingle with a waxy lanolin note on the nose of this intensely fruity, yet deeply complex kabinett. It's rich in stone fruit and mango flavors, but honed with steely minerality and citrus acidity that linger long after each sip.""";
1775;"Spain,3,2220,""Oak-heavy aromas of vanilla, graphite, blackberry and cassis come in front of a tannic, firm palate. Toasty blackberry aromas show a note of wood resin, while flavors of licorice and blackened toast ride high on a brisk finish. Drink this off-vintage Rioja through 2022.""";
1776;"Hungary,3,1080,""This dry Furmint hails from one of Tokaj's most famous vineyards—the Saint Thomas vineyard in the town of Mad.

1783;"Germany,13,7540,""While the attack of this dry wine is akin to biting into a perfectly ripened white peach, notes of salt and slate accumulate on the palate, lending a profound impression of minerality.

1788;"France,18,17820,""Wood and ripe fruit flavors drive this explosively fruity wine. Its richness is balanced by the acidity from green apple and lime fruits. Spice from the wood aging adds piquancy, leads to a final burst of textured minerality.""";
1789;"Australia,23,8280,""Truth be told, the difference in quality between this wine and the $125 Graveyard Vineyard bottling doesn't appear that great, so savvy consumers should jump on this Shiraz, which offers leather, coffee and roasted meat complexity allied to medium body, a creamy texture and a long, firmly structured finish.
